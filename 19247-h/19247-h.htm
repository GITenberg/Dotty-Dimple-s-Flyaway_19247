<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h4>BEGINNING TO REMEMBER.</h4>
<p>Katie Clifford was a very bright child.
She almost knew enough to keep out of
fire and water, but not quite. She looked
like other little girls, only so wise,&mdash;O,
so very wise!&mdash;that you couldn't tell her
any news about the earth, or the sun,
moon, and stars, for she knew all about
it "byfore."</p>

<p>Her hair was soft and flying like corn-silk,
and when the wind took it you would
think it meant to blow it off like a dandelion
top. She was so light and breezy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and so little for her age, that her father
said "they must put a cent in her pocket
to keep her from flying away;" so, after
that, the family began to call her <i>Flyaway</i>.
She thought it was her name, and
that when people said "Katie," it was a
gentle way they had of scolding.</p>

<p>Everybody petted her. Her brother
Horace put his heart right under her feet,
and she danced over it. Her "uncle Eddard"
said "she drove round the world
in a little chariot, and all her friends were
harnessed to it, only they didn't know it."</p>

<p>Her shoulders were very little, but they
bore a crushing weight of care. From
the time she began to talk, she took upon
herself the burden of the whole family.
When Mrs. Clifford had a headache, Flyaway
was so full of pity that nothing
could keep her from climbing upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sufferer, stroking her face, and saying,
"O, my <i>dee</i> mamma," or perhaps breaking
the camphor bottle over her nose.</p>

<p>She sat at table in a high chair beside
her father, and might have learned good
manners if it had not been for the care
she felt of Horace. She could scarcely
attend to her own little knife and fork,
because she was so busy watching her
brother. She wished to see for herself
that he was sitting straight, and not leaning
his elbows on the table. If he made
any mistake she cried, "Hollis!" in a
tone as sweet as a wind-harp, though she
meant it to be terribly severe, adding to
the effect by shaking the corn-silk on her
head in high displeasure. If she could
correct him she thought she had done as
much good in the family as if she had
behaved well herself. He received all re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>bukes
very meekly, with a "Thank you,
little Topknot. What would be done here
without you to preserve order?"</p>

<p>Flyaway could remember as far back as
the beginning of the world,&mdash;that is to
say, she could remember when <i>her</i> world
began.</p>

<p>It is strange to think of, but the first
thing she really knew for a certainty, she
was standing in a yellow chair, in her
grandmother Parlin's kitchen! It was as
if she had always been asleep till that
minute. People did say she had once
been a baby, but she could not recollect
that, "it was so <span class="smcap">many</span> years ago."</p>

<p>Her mind, you see, had always been
as soft as a bag of feathers; and nothing
that she did, or that any one else did,
made much impression. But now something
remarkable was taking place, and
she would never forget it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>It was this: she was grinding coffee.
How prettily it pattered down on the floor!
What did it look like? O, like snuff, that
people sneezed with. This was housework.
Next thing they would ask her to
wash dishes and set the table. She would
grow larger and larger, and Gracie would
grow littler and littler; and O, how nice
it would be when she could do all the
work, and Gracie had to sit in mamma's
lap and be rocked!</p>

<p>"Flywer'll do some help," said she.
"Flywer'll take 'are of g'amma's things."</p>

<p>While she stood musing thus, with a
dreamy smile, and turning the handle of
the mill as fast as it would go round,
somebody sprang at her very unexpectedly.
It was Ruth, the kitchen-girl. She
seized Katie by the shoulders, carried her
through the air, and set her on her feet
in the sink.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, little Mischief," said she, "you'll
stay there one while! We'll see if we
can't put a stop to this coffee-grinding!
Why, you're enough to wear out the patience
of Job!"</p>

<p>Katie had often heard about Job; she
supposed it was something dreadful, like a
lion, or a whale. She looked up at Ruth,
and saw her black eyes flashing and the
rosy color trembling in her cheeks. Cruel
Ruth! She did not know Katie was her
best friend, working and helping get dinner
as fast as she could. "Ruthie,"
sobbed she, "you didn't ask please."</p>

<p>"Well, well, child, I'm in a hurry; and
when you set things to flying, you're
enough to wear out the patience of Job."</p>

<p>Job again.</p>

<p>"You've said so two times, Ruthie!
Now I don't like you tall, tenny rate."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>This was as harsh language as Katie
dared use; but she frowned fearfully, and
a tuft of hair, rising from her head like
a waterspout, made her look so fierce
that Ruth seemed to be frightened, and
ran away with her apron up to her face.</p>

<p>The sink was so high that Katie could
not get out of it alone,&mdash;"course <i>indeed</i>
she couldn't."</p>

<p>"It most makes me 'fraid," said she to
herself: "Ruthie's a big woman, I's a little
woman. When I's the biggest I'll put
Ruthie in <i>my</i> sink."</p>

<p>Very much comforted by this resolve,
she dried her eyes and began to look
about her for more housework. "Let's
me see; I'll pump a bushel o' water."</p>

<p>There was a pail in the sink; so, what
should she do but jump into that, and
then jerk the pump-handle up and down,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
till a fine stream poured out and sprinkled
her all over!</p>

<p>"Sing a song, O sink-spout," sang she,
catching her breath: but presently she
began to feel cold.</p>

<p>"O, how it makes me <i>shivvle</i>!" said
she.</p>

<p>"Katie!" called out a voice.</p>

<p>"Here me are!" gurgled the little one,
her mouth under the pump-nose.</p>

<p>When Horace came in she was standing
in water up to the tops of her long white
stockings. He took her out, wrung her
a little, and set her on a shelf in the
pantry to dry.</p>

<p>"Oho!" said she, shaking her wet plumage,
like a duckling; "what for you
look that way to me? I didn't do nuffin,&mdash;not
the leastest nuffin! The water
kep' a comin' and a comin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you little naughty girl, and you
kept pumping and pumping."</p>

<p>"I'm isn't little naughty goorl," thought
Katie, indignantly; "but Ruthie's naughty
goorl, and Hollis <i>velly</i> naughty goorl."</p>

<p>"O, here you are, you little Hop-o'-my-thumb,"
said Mrs. Clifford, coming into
the pantry; "a baby with a cough in her
throat and pills in her pocket musn't get
wet."</p>

<p>Flyaway thrust her hand into her wet
pocket to make sure the wee vial of white
dots was still there.</p>

<p>"I fished her out of a pail of water,"
said Horace; "to-morrow I shall find her
in a bird's nest."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford sent for some fresh stockings
and shoes. Her baby-daughter was
so often falling into mischief that she
thought very little about it. She did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
know this was a remarkable occasion, and
the baby had to-day begun to remember.
She did not know that if Flyaway should
live to be an old lady, she would sometimes
say to her grandchildren,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The very first thing I have any recollection
of, dears, is grinding coffee in your
great-grandmamma's kitchen at Willowbrook.
The girl, Ruth Dillon, took me
up by the shoulders, carried me through
the air, and set me in the sink, and then
I pumped water over myself."</p>

<p>This is about the way little Flyaway
would be likely to talk, sixty years from
now, adding, as she polished her spectacles,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And after that, children, things went
into a mist, and I don't remember anything
else that happened for some time."</p>

<p>Why was it that things "went into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
mist"? Why didn't she keep on remembering
every day? I don't know.</p>

<p>But the next thing that really did happen
to Miss Thistleblow Flyaway, though
she went right off and forgot it, was this:
She persuaded her mother to write a letter
for her to "Dotty Dimpwill." As it was
her first letter, I will copy it.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My dear Dotty Dimpwill</span> first, then <span class="smcap">My
Prudy</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>"I'm going to say that I dink milk,
and that girl lost my pills.</p>

<p>"I see a hop-toad. He hopped. Jennie
took <i>her</i> up in <i>his</i> dress.</p>

<p>"And 'bout we put hop-toad in wash-dish.
He put his foots out, <i>stwetched</i>,
honest! He was a slippy fellow. First
thing we knowed it, he hopped on to her
dress. Isn't that funny?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now 'bout the chickens; they are trottin'
round on the grass: they didn't be
dead. <i>We</i> haven't got any only but dead
ones; but Mis' Gray has.</p>

<p>"I like Dr. Gray ever so much!</p>

<p>"Mis' Gray gave me the kitty to play
with. I bundled it all up in my dress,
'cause I didn't want the cat to get it.
When I went home I gave it to the cat.
[You got that <i>wroten</i>?]</p>

<p>"There wasn't any <i>dead</i> little kittens.
She gave me a cookie, and I eated it, and
I told her to give me another to bring
home, 'cause I liked her cookies; they was
curly cookies. [Got it wroted, mamma?]</p>

<p>"Now 'bout I pumped full a pail full
o' water.</p>

<p>"[She <i>knows</i> we've got a house?]</p>

<p>"Now say good by, and I kiss her a
pretty little kiss. O, no; I want her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
come and see me,&mdash;her and Prudy,&mdash;<i>two</i>
of 'em! I's here yet. ['Haps she knows
it!]</p>

<p>"That's all&mdash;I feel sleepy.</p>

<h3>RUNNING AWAY TO CHURCH.</h3>


<p>The little Parlins came the next week.
One Sunday morning Dotty Dimple stood
before the glass, putting on her hat for
church. Katie came and peeped in with
her, opening her small mouth and drawing
her lips over her teeth, as her grandfather
did when he shaved.</p>

<p>"See, Flyaway, you haven't any dimples
at all!" said Dotty, primping a little.
"Your hair isn't smooth and curly like
mine; it sticks up all over your head,
like a little fan."</p>

<p>"O, my shole!" sighed Flyaway, scowl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>ing
at herself. She did not know how
lovely she was, nor how</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The light of the heaven she came from<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still lingered and gleamed in her hair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I wisht 'twouldn't get out," said she.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by <i>out</i>?"</p>

<p>"O, unwetted, and un-comb-bid, and un-parted."</p>

<p>"That's because you fly about like such
a little witch."</p>

<p>"I doesn't do the leastest nuffin, Dotty
Dimpwill! Folks ought to let me to go
to churches."</p>

<p>"I <i>should</i> laugh, Fly Clifford, to see <i>you</i>
going to churches! All the ministers would
come down out of the pulpits and ask
what little mischief that was, and make
aunt 'Ria carry you home!"</p>

<p>"No, he wouldn't, too! I'd sit stiller'n<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
two, free, five hundred mouses," pleaded
Flyaway, climbing up the back of a chair
to show how quiet she could be.</p>

<p>"O, it's no use to talk about it, darling.
Give me one kiss, and I'll go get my sun-shade."</p>

<p>"Can't, Dotty Dimpwill! My mamma's
kiss I'll keep; it's ahind my mouf; she's
gone to 'Dusty.</p>

<p>"Well, 'keep it ahind your mouf,' then;
and here's another to put with it. What
<i>do</i> you s'pose makes me love to kiss you
so?"</p>

<p>"O, 'cause I so sweet," replied Flyaway,
promptly; but she was not thinking
of her own sweetness, just then; she was
wondering if she could manage to run
away to church.</p>

<p>"I'se a-goin' there myse'f! Sit still's a&mdash;a&mdash;"
She looked around for a com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>parison,
and saw a grasshopper on the
window-sill: "still's a <i>gas-papa</i>. Man
won't say nuffin' to me, see 'f he does!"</p>

<p>Strange such an innocent-looking child
could be so sly! She ran down the path
with Horace, kissing her little hand to
everybody for good by, all the while
thinking how she could steal off to church
without being seen.</p>

<p>"You may go up stairs and lie down
with me on my bed," said grandma, who
was not very well. So Katie climbed upon
the bed.</p>

<p>"My dee gamma, I so solly you's sick!"
said she, stroking Mrs. Parlin's face, and
picking open her eyelids. But after patting
and "pooring" the dear lady for some
time, she thought she had made her "all
well," and then was anxious to get away.
Mrs. Parlin wished to keep her up stairs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
as long as possible, because Ruth had a
toothache.</p>

<p>"Shan't I tell you a story, dear?" said
she.</p>

<p>"Yes, um; tell 'bout a long baby&mdash;no,
a long story 'bout a short baby."</p>

<p>"Well, once there was a king, and he
had a daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, no, gamma, not that! Tell me
'bout baby that <i>didn't</i> be on the bul-yushes;
I don't want to hear 'bout <i>Mosey</i>!"</p>

<p>Grandma smiled, and wondered if people,
in the good old Bible days, were in
the habit of using pet names, and if Pharaoh's
daughter ever called the Hebrew
boy "Mosey." She was about to begin
another story, when Flyaway said, "Guess
I'll go out, now," and slid off the bed.
There was an orange on the table. She
took it, held it behind her, and walked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
quickly to the door. Looking back, she
saw that her grandmother was watching
her.</p>

<p>"What you looking at, gamma? 'Cause
I'm are goin' to bring the ollinge right
back."</p>

<p>And so she did, but not because it was
wrong to keep it. Flyaway had no conscience,
or, if she had any, it was very
small, folded up out of sight, like a leaf-bud
on a tree in the spring.</p>

<p>"Ask Ruthie to wash your face and
hands, and then come right back to grandma
and hear the story."</p>

<p>"Yes um."</p>

<p>Down stairs she pattered. The moment
Ruth had kissed her, and turned
away to make a poultice, she crept into
the nursery, and put on Horace's straw hat.
Then she took from a corner an old cane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of her grandfather's, and from the paper-rack
a daily newspaper, and started out
in great glee. The "Journal" she hugged
to her heart, and her short dress she held
up to her waist, "'Cause I s'pect I mus'
keep it out o' the mud," said she, as anxiously
as any lady with a train.</p>

<p>She had no trouble in finding the church,
for the road was straight, but the cane
kept tripping her up.</p>

<p>"Naughty fing! Wisht I hadn't took
you, to-day, you act so bad!" said she,
picking herself up for the fifth time, and
slinging the "naughty fing" across her
shoulder like a gun. When she came to
the meeting-house there was not a soul to
be seen. "Guess they's eatin' dinner in
here," decided Flyaway, after looking about
for a few seconds. "Guess I'll go up
chamer, see where the folks is."</p>

<p class="center"><img class="img1" src="images/image_03.jpg" alt="Running away to Church." width="400" height="623" /><br />
<span class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Running away to Church</span>.</span></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>Up stairs she clattered, hitting the balusters
with her cane. Good Mr. Lee was
preaching from the text, "Remember the
Sabbath day, to keep it holy," and people
could not imagine who was naughty enough
to make such a noise outside&mdash;thump,
thump, thump.</p>

<p>"Who's that a-talkin'?" thought Flyaway,
startled by Mr. Lee's voice. "O, ho!
that's the <i>prayer-man</i> a-talkin'. He makes
me kind o' 'fraid!"</p>

<p>But just at that minute she had reached
the top of the stairs, and was standing in
the doorway.</p>

<p>"O, my shole! so <i>many</i> folks!"</p>

<p>She trembled, and was about to run
away with her newspaper and cane; but
her eyes, in roving wildly about, fell upon
grandpa Parlin and all the rest of them,
in a pew very near the pulpit. Then she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
thought it must be all right, and, taking
courage, she marched slowly up the aisle,
swinging the cane right and left.</p>

<p>Everybody looked up in surprise as the
droll little figure crept by. Grandpa
frowned through his spectacles, and aunt
Louise shook her head; but Horace hid
his face in a hymn-book and Dotty Dimple
actually smiled.</p>

<p>"They didn't know <i>I</i> was a-comin',"
thought Flyaway, "but I camed!"</p>

<p>And with that she fluttered into the
pew.</p>

<p>"Naughty, naughty girl," said aunt Louise,
in an awful whisper.</p>

<p>She longed to take up the morsel of
naughtiness, called Katie, in her thumb and
finger, shake it, and carry it out. But
there was a twinkle in the little one's eye
that might mean mischief; she did not
dare touch her.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>"O, what a child!" said aunt Louise,
taking off the big hat and setting Flyaway
down on the seat as hard as she
could.</p>

<p>Flyaway looked up, through her veil of
flossy hair, at her pretty auntie with the
roses round her face.</p>

<p>"Nobody didn't take 'are o' me to my
house," said she, in a loud whisper, "and
<i>that's</i> what is it!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said aunt Louise, giving Flyaway
another shake, which frightened her
so that she dropped her head on her brother's
shoulder, and sat perfectly still for
half a minute.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise was sadly mortified, and
so were Susy and Prudy. They dared
not look up, for they thought everybody
was gazing straight at the Parlin pew, and
laughing at their crazy little relative. Hor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>ace
and Dotty Dimple did not care in
the least; they thought it very funny.</p>

<p>"They shan't scold at my cunning little
Topknot," whispered Horace, consolingly.
"Sit still, darling, and when we get home
I'll give you a cent."</p>

<p>"Yes um, I will," replied poor brow-beaten
Flyaway, and held up her head
again with the best of them. Perhaps she
had been naughty; perhaps folks were
going to snip her fingers; but "Hollis"
was on her side now and forever. She
began to feel quite contented. She had
got inside the church at last, and was very
well pleased with it. It was even queerer
than she had expected.</p>

<p>"What was that high-up thing the prayer-man
was a-standin' on?"</p>

<p>Flyaway merely asked this of her own
wise little brain. She concluded it must
be "a chimley."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great red curtains ahind him," added
she, still conversing with her own little
brain. "Lots o' great big bubbles on the
walls all round. Big's a tea-kiddle! Lamps,
I s'pose. There's that table. Where's the
cups and saucers for the supper? And
the tea-pot?</p>

<p>"All the bodies everywhere had their
bonnets on; why for? Didn't say a word,
and the prayer-man kep' a-talkin' all the
time; why for? Flywer didn't talk; no
indeed. Folks mus'n't. If folks did, then
the man would come down out the chimley
and tell the other bodies to carry 'em
home. 'Cause it's the holy Sabber-day,&mdash;and
<i>that's</i> what is it."</p>

<p>Flyaway's airy brain went dancing round
and round. She slid away from Horace's
shoulder, spread her little length upon the
seat, closed her wondering, tired eyes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
sailed off to Noddle's Island. A fly, buzzing
in from out doors, had long been trying
to settle on Flyaway's restless nose.
He never did settle: Horace kept guard
with a palm-leaf fan, and "all the other
bodies" in the pew sat as still as if they
had been nailed down; so anxious were
they to keep the little sleeper safely harbored
at Noddle's Island.</p>

<p>"Such a relief!" thought aunt Louise,
venturing to look up once more.</p>

<p>Flyaway did not waken till the last
prayer, when Horace held her fast, lest
she should make a sudden rush upon a
speckled dog, which came trotting up the
aisle.</p>

<p>On the steps they met Ruth, with wild
eyes and face tied up in a scarf, hunting
for Flyaway. Mrs. Parlin, she said, was
going up the hill, so frightened that it
would make her "down sick."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>When grandma got home, all out of
breath, she found Flyaway looking very
downcast. Her heart was heavy under so
many scoldings. "O, Katie," said grandma,
"how could you run away?"</p>

<p>"I didn't yun away," replied Flyaway,
thrusting her finger into her mouth; "I
<i>walked</i> away!"</p>

<p>"There, if that isn't a cunning baby,
where'll you find one?" whispered brother
Horace to Prudy. "Grandmother can't punish
her after such a 'cute speech."</p>

<p>But grandmother could, and did. She
took her by the little soft hand, led her
to the china closet, and locked her in.</p>

<p>"Half an hour you must stay there,"
said she, "and think what a naughty girl
you've been!"</p>

<p>"Yes um," said Flyaway, meekly, and
wiped off a tear with the hem of her frock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>But the moment she was left alone, her
quick, observing eyes saw something which
gave her a thrill of delight. It was a jar
of quince jelly, which had been left by
accident on the lower shelf.</p>

<p>"'Cause I spect I likes um," said she,
serenely, after eating all she possibly could.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour grandma
came and turned the key.</p>

<p>"Have you been thinking, dear, and
are you sorry and ready to come out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, um," replied the little culprit,
with her mouth full, and feeling very brave
as long as the door was shut between her
and her jailer. "Yes, um, I've thought it
all up,&mdash;defful solly. <i>But</i> you won't
never shut me up no more, gamma Parlin!"</p>

<p>"Katie Clifford!" said grandma, sternly;
and then she opened the door, and faced
Flyaway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Cause&mdash;'cause&mdash;<i>'cause</i>," cried the little
one, in great alarm; "you won't shut
me up, 'cause I won't never walk away
no more, gamma Parlin!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin tried hard not to smile; but
the mixture on Flyaway's little face of
naughtiness, jelly, and fright, was very
funny to see.</p>

<p>The child noticed that her grandmother's
brows knit as if in displeasure, and
then she remembered the jelly.</p>

<p>"I hasn't been a-touchin' your 'serves,
gamma," said she.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin really did not know what
to do,&mdash;Flyaway's conscience was <i>so</i> little
and folded away in so many thicknesses,
like a tiny pearl in a whole box of cotton
wool. How could anybody get at it?</p>

<p>"Gamma, I hasn't been a-touchin' your
'serves," repeated the little thief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, don't tell me that," said grandma,
sadly; "I see it in your eye!"</p>

<p>"What, gamma, the <i>'serves</i> in my eye?"
said Flyaway, putting up her finger to find
out for herself. "'Cause I put 'em in my
<i>mouf</i>, I did."</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin washed the little pilferer's
face and hands, took her in her lap, and
tried to feel her way through the cotton
wool to the tiny conscience.</p>

<p>The child looked up and listened to all
the good words, and when they had been
spoken over and over, this was what she
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, gamma, you's got such pitty little
wrinkles!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>RUNNING AWAY TO HEAVEN.</h3>


<p>About ten o'clock one morning, Flyaway
was sitting in the little green chamber
with Dotty Dimple and Jennie Vance,
bathing her doll's feet in a glass of water.
Dinah had a dreadful headache, and her
forehead was bandaged with a red ribbon.</p>

<p>"<i>Does</i> you feel any better?" asked Flyaway,
tenderly, from time to time; but
Dinah had such a habit of never answering,
that it was of no use to ask her any
questions.</p>

<p>Dotty Dimple and Jennie were talking
very earnestly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do wish I did know where Charlie
Gray is!" said Dotty, looking through the
open window at a bird flying far aloft into
the blue sky.</p>

<p>"You do know," answered Jennie, quickly;
"he's in heaven."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; but so high up&mdash;O,
so high up," sighed Dotty, "it makes you
dizzy to think."</p>

<p>"Can um see we?" struck in little Flyaway,
holding to Dinah's flat nose a bottle
of reviving soap suds.</p>

<p>"Prudy says it's beautiful to be dead,"
added Dotty, without heeding the question;
"beautiful to be dead."</p>

<p>"Shtop!" cried Flyaway; "I's a-talkin'.
Does um see <i>we</i>?"</p>

<p>"O, I don' know, Fly Clifford; you'll
have to ask the minister."</p>

<p>Flyaway squeezed the water from Dinah's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ragged feet, and dropped her under the
table, headache and all. Then she tipped
over the goblet, and flew to the window.</p>

<p>"The Charlie boy likes canny seeds;
I'll send him some," said she, pinning a
paper of sugared spices to the window curtain,
and drawing it up by means of the
tassel. "O, dear, um don't go high enough.
Charlie won't get 'em."</p>

<p>"Why, what is that baby trying to do?"
said Dotty Dimple.</p>

<p>"Charlie's defful high up," murmured Flyaway,
heaving a little sigh; "can't get the
canny seeds."</p>

<p>"O, what a Fly! How big do you s'pose
her mind is, Jennie Vance?"</p>

<p>"Big as a thimble, perhaps," replied
Jennie, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Why, I shouldn't think, now, 'twas
any larger than the head of a pin," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Dotty, with decision; "s'poses heaven is
top o' this room! Why, Jennie Vance, I
<i>persume</i> it's ever so much further off 'n
Mount Blue&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, indeed! What queer ideas
such children do have! Flyaway doesn't
understand but very little we say, Dotty
Dimple; not but very little."</p>

<p>Flyaway turned round with one of her
wise looks. She thought she did understand;
at any rate she was catching every
word, and stowing it away in her little bit
of a brain for safe keeping. Heaven was
on Mount Blue. She had learned so much.</p>

<p>"But I knowed it by-fore," said she to
herself, with a proud toss of the silky
plume on the crown of her head.</p>

<p>"Shall we take her with us?" asked
Jennie Vance.</p>

<p>Flyaway listened eagerly; she thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
they were still talking of heaven, when
in truth Jennie only meant a concert which
was to be given that afternoon at the
vestry.</p>

<p>"Take <i>that</i> little snip of a child!" replied
Dotty; "O, no; she isn't big enough;
'twouldn't be any use to pay money for
<i>her!</i>"</p>

<p>With which very cutting remark Dotty
swept out of the room, in her queenly
way, followed by Jennie. Flyaway threw
herself across a pillow, and moaned,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, dee, dee!"</p>

<p>Her little heart was ready to bleed;
and this wasn't the first time, either.
Those great big girls were always running
away from her, and calling her "goosies"
and "snips;" and now they meant to climb
to heaven, where Charlie was, and leave
her behind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I won't stay down here in this
place; I'll go to heaven too, now, <i>cerdily</i>!"
She sprang from the pillow and
stood on one foot, like a strong-minded
little robin that will not be trifled with
by a worm. "I'll go too, now, cerdily."</p>

<p>Having made up her mind, she hurried
as fast as she could, and tucked a stick
of candy in her pocket, also the bottle of
soap suds, and two thirds of a "curly
cookie" shaped like a leaf. "Charlie would
be so glad to see Fly-wer!" She purred
like a contented kitten as she thought about
it. "'Haps they've got a <i>bossy-cat</i> up
there, and a piggy, and a swing. O, my
shole!"</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost. Flyaway
must overtake the girls, and, if possible,
get to heaven before they did. She
flew about like a distracted butterfly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must have some skipt; her said me's
too little to pay for money;" and she curled
her pretty red lip; "but I'm isn't much
little; man'll <i>want</i> some skipt."</p>

<p>For she fancied somebody standing at
the door of heaven holding out his hand
like the ticket-man at the depot. She
found her mother's purse in the writing-desk,
and scattered its contents into the
wash-bowl, then picked out the wettest
"skipt," a five-dollar bill, and tucked it
into her bosom. This would make it all
right at the door of heaven.</p>

<p>"Now my spetty-curls," she added, hunting
in the "uppest drawer" till she found
the eyeless spectacles used for playing "old
lady." With these on, Flyaway thought
she could see the way a great deal better.
Horace's boots would help her up hill;
so she jumped into those, and clattered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
down the back stairs with Dinah under
her arm.</p>

<p>There was nobody in the kitchen, for
Ruthie was down cellar sweeping. Flyaway
caught her shaker off the "short nail,"
and stole out without being seen. Sitting
in the sun on the piazza was the "blue"
kittie. "Finkin' 'bout a mouse, I spect,"
said little Flyaway, seizing her and blowing
open her eyes like a couple of rosebuds.</p>

<p>"Does you know where I's a-goin'? Up
to heaven. We don't let tinty folks, like
cats, go to heaven."</p>

<p>Pussy winked sorrowfully at this, and
baby's tender heart was touched.</p>

<p>"Yes, we does," said she; "but you
musn't scwatch the Charlie boy;" and she
tucked the "tinty folks" under her left
arm. Then all was ready, and the little
pilgrim started for heaven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Um's on the toppest hill," said she,
looking at the far-off mountains, reaching
up against the blue sky. One mountain
was much higher than the others, and on
that she fixed her eye. It was Mount
Blue, and was really twenty miles away.
If Flyaway should ever reach that cloud-capped
peak, it was not her wee, wee feet
which would carry her there. But the baby
had no idea of distances. She went out
of the yard as fast as the big boots would
allow. She felt as brave as a little fly
trying to walk the whole length of the
Chinese Wall.</p>

<p>Where were Dotty Dimple and Jennie
Vance? O, they were half way to heaven
by this time; she must "hurry quick."</p>

<p>The fact was, they were "up in the
Pines," picking strawberries. Nobody saw
Flyaway but a caterpillar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, my shole! there's a <i>catty-pillow</i>&mdash;what
he want, you fink?"</p>

<p>Kitty winked and Dinah sulked, but
there was no reply.</p>

<p>The next thing they met was a grasshopper.
"O, dee, a <i>gas-papa</i>! Where
you s'pose um goin'?"</p>

<p>Kitty winked again and Dinah sulked.</p>

<p>Flyaway answered her own question.
"Diny, dat worm gone see his mamma."</p>

<p>Dinah did not care anything about the
family feelings of the "worms;" so she
kept her red silk mouth shut; but she
grew very heavy&mdash;so heavy, indeed, that
once her little mother dropped her in the
sand, but picking her up, shook her and
trudged on. Presently she dropped something
else, and this time it was the kitty.
Flyaway turned about in dismay.</p>

<p>"Shtop," cried she, scowling through her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
"spetty-curls," as she saw three white paws
and one blue one go tripping over the
road.  "Shtop!" But the paws kept on.</p>

<p>"O, Diny," said Flyaway, as pussy's tail
disappeared round a corner,&mdash;"O, Diny,
her don't want to go to heaven!"</p>

<p>Then Flyaway sat down in the sand,
and pulled off one of the big boots.</p>

<p>"Um won't walk," said she; but, before
she had time to pull off the second one,
a dog came along and frightened her so
she tried to run, though she only hopped
on one foot, and dragged the other. She
did not know what the matter was till she
fell down and the boot came off of itself,
after which she could walk very well.
What cared she that both "Hollis's" new
boots were left in the road, ready to be
crushed by wagon wheels?</p>

<p>She kept on and kept on; but where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
was that blue hill going to? It moved
faster than she did.</p>

<p>"Makes me povokin'," said she, giving
Dinah a shake. "Um runs away and away,
and all off!"</p>

<p>Sometimes she remembered she was going
to heaven, and sometimes she forgot it. She
was on the way to the "Pines," and many
little flowers grew by the road-side. She
began to pick a few, but the thorns on the
raspberry bushes tore her tender hands,
and one of the naughty branches caught
Dinah by the frizzly hair, and carried her
under. What did Flyaway spy behind
the bushes? Dotty Dimple and Jennie
Vance. They were eating wintergreen
leaves; they did not see her. Flyaway
kept as still as if she were sitting for a
photograph, picked up Dinah, gave her a
hug, and crept on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>She went so quietly that nobody heard
her. When she was out of sight she purred
for joy. She had got ahead of the girls
on the way to heaven! She took the stick
of candy out of her pocket and nibbled it
to celebrate the occasion. "A little hump-backed
bumblebee" saw her do it. He
wanted some too, and followed Flyaway
as if she had been a moving honeysuckle.
For half a mile or more she "gaed" and
she "gaed," all the while nibbling the
candy; but now she was growing very
tired, and did it to comfort herself. Suddenly
she remembered it was Charlie's candy.
She held it up to her tearful eyes.</p>

<p>"O dee," said she, "it was big, but it
keeps a-gettin' little!"</p>

<p>The hungry bumblebee, who was just
behind her, thought this was his last chance:
so he pounced down upon Charlie's candy;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and being cross, and not knowing Flyaway
from any other little girl, he stung her on
the thumb. Then how she cried, "'Orny
'ting me! 'Orny 'ting me!" for she had
been treated just so before by a hornet.
"O my dee mamma! My dee mamma!"</p>

<p>But her "dee" mamma could not hear
her; she was in the city of Augusta; and
as for the rest of the family, they supposed
Flyaway was playing "catch" with Dotty

<h3>"A RAILROAD SAVAGE."</h3>


<p>It now occurred to little Flyaway, with
a sudden pang, that she must have come
to the end of the world. "Yes, cerdily!"
The world was full of folks and houses,&mdash;this
place was nothing but trees. The
world had horses and wagons in it,&mdash;this
place hadn't. "O dee!"</p>

<p>Where was the hill gone, on the top of
which stood that big house they called heaven,&mdash;the
house where Charlie lived and
played in the garden? Why, that hill had
just walked off, and the house too! She parted
the bushes and peeped through. Nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to be seen but trees. Flyaway began to cry
from sheer fright, as well as pain. "'Tis
a defful day! I can't <i>stay</i> in this day!"</p>

<p>More trouble had come to her than she
knew how to bear; but worst of all was
the cruel stab of the bumblebee. She
pitied her aching "fum," and kissed it
herself to make it feel better; but all in
vain; "the pain kept on and on;" the
"fum" grew big as fast as the candy had
grown little.</p>

<p>"Somebody don't take 'are o' me," wailed
she; "somebody gone off, lef' me alone!"</p>

<p>She was dreadfully hungry. "When <i>was</i>
it be dinner time?" She would not have
been in the least surprised, but very much
pleased, if a bird had flown down with a
plate of roast lamb in his bill, and set it
on the ground before her. Simple little
Flyaway! Or if her far-away mother had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sprung out from behind a tree with a bed
in her arms, the tired baby would have
jumped into the bed and asked no questions.</p>

<p>But nothing of the sort came to pass.
Here she was, without any heaven or any
mother; and the great yellow sun was
creeping fast down the sky.</p>

<p>"I'm tired out and sleepy out," wailed
the young traveller, the tears rolling over
the rims of her "spetty-curls,"&mdash;"all sleepy
out; and I can't get rested 'thout&mdash;my&mdash;muvver!"</p>

<p>She sat down and hid her head in her
black dolly's bosom.</p>

<p>"Diny, you got some ears? We wasn't
here by-fore!"</p>

<p>This was all the way she had of saying
she was lost.</p>

<p>The sky suddenly grew dark; a shower
was coming up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where has the bwight sun gone?" said
Flyaway, with a shudder.</p>

<p>She was answered by a peal of thunder,&mdash;wagon-wheels,
she supposed.</p>

<p>"Here I is!" shouted she.</p>

<p>Some one had come for her. Perhaps
it was Charlie, and they meant to give her
a ride up to heaven. A flash of light, and
then another crash. Flyaway understood
it then. It was logs. People were rolling
logs up in the sky, on the blue floor. She
had seen logs in a mill. Such a noise!</p>

<p>Then she dropped fast asleep, and somebody
came right down out of the clouds
and gave her a peach turnover as big as
a dinner basket, or so she thought. Just
as she was about to cut it, she was awakened
by the rain dripping into her eyes.
She started up, exclaiming, "If you pees
um, I want some cheese um."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>But the turnover had gone! Then the
feeling of desolation swept over her again.
She had come to the end of the world,
and dinner, and mother, and heaven had
all gone off and left her.</p>

<p>"O, Diny," sobbed she, turning to her
unfeeling dolly for sympathy. "I's free
years old, and you's one years old. Don't
you want to go to heaven, Diny, and sit
in God's lap? What a great big lap he
must have!"</p>

<p>A gust of wind lifted the frizzles on
Dinah's forehead, but that was all.</p>

<p>"O dee, dee, dee! you don't hear nuffin
't all, Diny," said Flyaway&mdash;the only sensible
remark she had made that day. It
was of no use talking to Dinah; so she
began to talk to herself.</p>

<p>"What you matter, Flywer Clifford?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
said she, scowling to keep her courage up.
"What you matter?"</p>

<p>And after she had said that, she cried
harder than ever, and crept under the
bushes, moaning like a wounded lamb.</p>

<p>"I'm defful wetter, but I'm colder'n I's
wetter; makes me shivvle!"</p>

<p>After a while the clouds had poured out
all the rain there was in them, and left
the sky as clear as it was before; but by
that time the sun had gone to bed, and
the little birds too, sending out their good
nights from tree to tree. Then the new
moon came, and peeped over the shoulder
of a hill at Flyaway. She sprang out from
the bushes like a rabbit.</p>

<p>"O, my shole!" cried she, clapping her
hands, "the sun's camed again! A little
bit o' sun. I sawed it!"</p>

<p class="center"><img class="img1" src="images/image_04.jpg" alt="Lost in the Woods." width="600" height="382" /><br />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Lost in the Woods</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>Inspired with new courage, she and
Dinah concluded to start for home; that
is to say, they turned round three or
four times, and then struck off into the
woods.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Now you may be sure all this could not
happen without causing great alarm at
grandpa Parlin's. When the dinner bell
rang, everybody asked, twice over, "Why,
where is little Fly?" and Dotty Dimple
answered, as innocently as if it were none
of her affairs,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, isn't she in the house? We
s'posed she was. Jennie Vance and I have
just been out in the garden, under your
little <i>crying willow</i>, making a wreath.
Thought she was in the barn, or somewhere."</p>

<p>"But you haven't been in the garden all
the while?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"No'm; once we went up in the Pines,&mdash;grandma,
you said we might,&mdash;but we
haven't seen Fly,&mdash;why, we haven't seen
her for the longest while!"</p>

<p>Grace had dropped her knife and fork
and was looking pale.</p>

<p>"It was Susy and I that had the care
of her, grandma; when you went out to
see the sick lady, you charged us, and
we forgot all about it."</p>

<p>"Pretty works, I should think!" cried
Horace, springing out of his chair; "I
wouldn't sell that baby for her weight in
gold; but I reckon <i>you</i> would, Grace Clifford,
and be glad of it, too."</p>

<p>Grandma held up a warning finger. "I
declare," said aunt Louise, very much agitated,
"I never shall consent to have Maria
go out of town again, and leave Katie with
us. If she will try to swim in the watering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>-trough,
she is just as likely to take a walk
on the ridgepole of the house."</p>

<p>Horace darted out of the room with a
ghastly face, but came back looking relieved.
He had been up in the attic, and
climbed through the scuttle, without finding
any human Fly on the roof, or on the
dizzy tops of the chimneys, either.</p>

<p>But where was the child? Had Ruth
seen her? Had Abner?</p>

<p>No; the last that could be remembered,
she had been playing by herself in the
green chamber, soaking Dinah's feet in a
glass of water. The "blue kitty," the only
creature who had anything to tell, sat
washing her face on the kitchen hearth,
and yawning sleepily. Fly's shaker was
gone from the "short nail," and aunt Louise
discovered some bank-bills in a wash-bowl,&mdash;"Fly's
work, of course." But this
was all they knew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandpa searched the barn, Abner the
fields, Ruth the cellar; aunt Louise and
Horace ran down to the river. In half
an hour several of the neighbors had joined
in the search.</p>

<p>"I always thought there would be a last
time," said poor Mrs. Dr. Gray, putting
on her black bonnet, and joining Grace
and Susy. "That child seems to me like
a little spirit, or a fairy, and I never thought
she would live long. She and Charlie
were too lovely for this world."</p>

<p>"O, <i>don't</i>, Mrs. Gray," said Grace. "If
you knew how often she'd been lost, you
would not say so! We always find her,
after a while, somewhere."</p>

<p>Horace, who had gone on in advance,
now came running back, swinging his boots
in the air.</p>

<p>"A trail!" cried he. "I've found a trail!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Who planted these boots in the road, if
it wasn't Fly Clifford?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she has gone to aunt Martha's,"
said Mrs. Parlin, "or tried to.
Strange we did not think of that!"</p>

<p>But aunt Martha had not seen her, nor
had any one else. Horace and Abner went
up to the Pines, but the forest beyond they
never thought of exploring; it did not
seem probable that such a small child
could have strolled to such a distance as
that.</p>

<p>Supper time came and went. There was
a short thunder-shower. The Parlins shuddered
at every flash of lightning, and shivered
at every drop of rain; for where was
delicate, lost little Fly?</p>

<p>Abner and Horace were out during the
shower. Horace would have braved hur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>ricanes
and avalanches in the cause of his
dear little Topknot.</p>

<p>"There's one thing we haven't thought
of," said Abner, shaking the drops from
his hat and looking up at the sky, which
had cleared again; "we haven't thought of
the railroad surveyors! They are round
the town everywhere with their compasses
and spy-glasses."</p>

<p>It was not a bad idea of Abner's. He
and Horace went to the hotel where the
railroad men boarded. The engineer's face
lighted at once.</p>

<p>"I wish I had known before there was
a child missing," he said. "I saw the
figure of a little girl, through my glass,
not an hour ago. It was a long way beyond
the Pines, and I wondered how such
a baby happened up there; but I had so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
much else to think of that it passed out
of my mind."</p>

<p>About eight o'clock, Flyaway was found
in the woods, sound asleep, under a hemlock
tree, her faithful Dinah hugged close
to her heart.</p>

<p>There was a shout from a dozen mouths.
Horace's eyes overflowed. He caught his
beloved pet in his arms.</p>

<p>"O, little Topknot!" he cried. "Who's
got you? Look up, look up, little Brown-brimmer."</p>

<p>All Flyaway could do was to sob gently,
and then curl her head down on her brother's
shoulder, saying, sleepily, "Cold, ou'
doors stayin'."</p>

<p>"Why did our darling run away?"</p>

<p>"Didn't yun away; I's goin' up to
heaven see Charlie," replied Flyaway, suddenly
remembering the object of her jour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>ney,
and gazing around at Abner, Dr.
Gray, and the other people, with eyes full
of wonder. "Where's the toppest hill? I's
goin' up, carry Charlie some canny."</p>

<p>The people formed a line, and, as Prudy
said, "processed" behind Katie all the way
to the village.</p>

<p>"Is we goin' to heaven?" said the child,
still bewildered. "It yunned away and
away, and all off!"</p>

<p>"No, you blessed baby, you are not
going to heaven just yet, if we can help
it," answered Dr. Gray, leaning over Horace's
shoulder to kiss the child.</p>

<p>Flyaway was too tired to ask any more
questions. She let first one person carry
her, and then another, sometimes holding
up her swollen thumb, and murmuring,
"'Orny 'ting me&mdash;tell my mamma." And
after that she was asleep again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Dotty Dimple, Susy, and Prudy were
pacing the piazza when the party arrived,
but poor grandma was on the sofa in the
parlor, quite overcome with anxiety and
fatigue, and Miss Polly Whiting was mournfully
fanning her with a black feather fan.
The sound of voices roused Mrs. Parlin.
"Safe! safe!" was the cry. Dotty Dimple
rushed in, shouting, "A railroad savage
found her! a railroad savage found
her!"</p>

<p>In another moment the runaway was in
her grandmother's lap. All she could say
was, "'Orny 'ting me on my fum! 'Orny
'ting me on my fum!" For this one
little bite of a bee seemed greater to Flyaway
Clifford than all the dangers she had
passed. If grandma would only kiss her
"fum," it was no matter about going to
heaven, or even being undressed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>But after she had had a bowl of bread
and milk, and been nicely bathed, she forgot
her sufferings, and laughed in her
sleep. She was dreaming how Charlie
came to the door of heaven and helped
her up the steps.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>EAST AGAIN.</h3>


<p>A whole year passed. Dotty Dimple
became a school-girl, with a "bosom friend"
and a pearl ring. Prudy, who called herself
"the middle-aged sister," grew tall and
slender. Katie was four years old, and
just a little heavier, so she no longer
needed a cent in her pocket to keep her
from blowing away.</p>

<p>The Parlins had been at Willowbrook a
week before the Cliffords arrived. There
was a great sensation over Katie. She was
delighted to hear that she had grown more
than any of the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm gettin' old all over!" said she,
gayly. "Four&mdash;goin' to be five! Wish
I was most six. Dotty Dimpul, don't you
wish <i>you's</i> most a <i>hunderd</i>?"</p>

<p>"O, you cunning little cousin!" said
Dotty, embracing her rapturously; "I wish
you loved me half as well as I love you;
that's what I wish. I told Tate Penny
you were prettier than Tid; and so you
are. Such red cheeks! But what makes
one cheek redder than the other?"</p>

<p>"O, I eat my bread 'n' milk that side o'
my mouf," replied Flyaway; "and that's
why."</p>

<p>"What an idea! And your hair is just
as fine as ever it was; the color of my
ring&mdash;isn't it, Prudy?"</p>

<p>Flyaway put her little hand to her head,
and felt the floss flying about as usual.</p>

<p>"My hair comes all to pieces," explained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
she; "<i>or nelse</i> I have a ribbon to tie it
up with."</p>

<p>"Are you glad to come back to Willowbrook,
you precious little dear?" asked
two or three voices.</p>

<p>"Yes 'm," said Flyaway, doubtfully;
"Y&mdash;es&mdash;um."</p>

<p>"She doesn't remember anything about
it, I guess," said Prudy, kneeling before
the little one, and kissing the sweet place
in her neck.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Flyaway, winking
hard and breathing quick in the effort to
recall the very dim and very distant past;
"yes, I 'member."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you 'member?"</p>

<p>"O, once I was grindin' coffee out there
in a yellow chair, and somebody she came
and put me in the sink."</p>

<p>"She does know&mdash;doesn't she?" said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Dotty. "That was Ruthie; come out in
the kitchen and see her."</p>

<p>But when Flyaway first looked into Ruth's
smiling face, with its black eyes and sharp
nose, she could not remember that she had
ever seen it before. Abner, too, was
strange to her.</p>

<p>"Come here," said he, "and I can tell
in a minute if you are a good little girl."</p>

<p>Flyaway cast down her soft eyes, and
sidled along to Abner.</p>

<p>"Here, touch this watch," said he, "and
if you are a good little girl it will fly open;
if you are naughty it will stay shut."</p>

<p>Flyaway looked askance at Abner, her
finger in her mouth, but dared not touch
the watch.</p>

<p>"Who'd 'a thought it, now?" said Abner,
pretending to be shocked. "Looks
to be a nice child; but of course she isn't,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
or she'd come right up and open the
watch."</p>

<p>Flyaway thrust another finger in her
mouth, and pressed her eyelids slowly together.
Abner did not understand this,
but it meant that he had not treated her
with proper respect.</p>

<p>"Here, Ruth," said he, in a low tone,
"hand me one of your plum tarts; that'll
fetch her.&mdash;Come here, my pretty one,
and see what's inside of this little pie."</p>

<p>Flyaway was very hungry. She took a
step forward, and held her hand out, though
rather timidly.</p>

<p>"But she mustn't eat it without asking
her mamma," said Ruth.</p>

<p>"Yes; O, yes," cried Miss Flyaway,
opening her little mouth for the first time,
and shutting it again over a big bite of
tart; "I want to eat it and <i>s'prise</i> my
mamma."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Abner laughed in his hearty fashion.
"Some of the old mischief left there yet,"
said he, catching Flyaway and tossing her
to the ceiling. "Have you come here this
summer to keep the whole house in commotion?
Remember the Charlie boy&mdash;don't
you&mdash;that had the meal-bags tied
to his feet?"</p>

<p>"Did he? What for?"</p>

<p>Flyaway had not the least recollection
of Charlie; but Horace had talked to her
about him, and she said, after a moment's
thought,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, he washed the pig. Me and
Charlie, we played all everything what we
thinked about."</p>

<p>"So you did, surely," said a woman
who had just come in at the back door,
and begun to drop kisses, as sad as tears,
on Flyaway's forehead. "Do you know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
who this is?" Flyaway looked up with a
sweet smile, but her mind had lost all impression
of her melancholy friend, Miss
Whiting. "Look again," said the sad-eyed
stranger, who did not like to have
even a little child forget her; "you used
to call me the 'Polly woman.'"</p>

<p>Katie looked again, and this time very
closely.</p>

<p>"There's a great deal o' yellowness in
your face," exclaimed she, after a careful
survey; "but you was made so!"</p>

<p>Miss Polly laughed drearily. "So you
don't remember how I took you out of
the watering-trough, you sweet lamb! 'I's
tryin' to swim,' you said; 'and <i>that's</i> what
is it.' Here's a summer-sweeting for you,
dear; do you like them?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm, thank you," said Flyaway, "but
I like summer-<i>sourings</i> the best."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time she allowed herself to
be taken in Miss Polly's lap, and won that
tender-hearted woman's love by putting her
arms round her neck, and saying, "Let
me kiss you so you'll feel all better. What
makes you have tears in your eyes?&mdash;tell
me."</p>

<p>"We're good friends&mdash;I knew we
should be," said Miss Polly, quite cheerily.
"Look out of the window, and see that
swing. How many times I've pushed you
and Dotty in that swing when it seemed
as if it would break my back!"</p>

<p>Flyaway looked out. There stood the
two trees, and between them hung the old
swing; but the charm was forgotten. In
the field beyond, her eye fell on an object
more interesting to her.</p>

<p>"O, O," said she, "I don't see how God
<i>could</i> make a man so homebly as that!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"So homely as what?"</p>

<p>"Why," laughed Dotty, "she means that
scarecrow."</p>

<p>The corn was up long ago, but one direful
image had still been left to flaunt in
the sunlight and soak in the rain.</p>

<p>"That isn't a man," said Prudy; "it's
only a great monstrous rag baby, with a
coat on."</p>

<p>"Put there to frighten away the crows,"
added Miss Polly. "When Abner dropped
corn in the ground, the great black crows
wanted to come and pick it out, and eat
it up."</p>

<p>Flyaway frowned in token of strong dislike
to the crows. "I wouldn't eat gampa's
corn for anything in this world," said
she,&mdash;"'thout it's popped! 'Cause I don't
like it."</p>

<p>Miss Polly laughed quite merrily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"There," said she, "I've dropped a stitch
in my side; it never agrees with me to
laugh. I must be going right home, too;
but there is one thing more I want to ask
you, Katie; do you remember how you
ran away, one day, and frightened the whole
house, trying to climb up to heaven?"</p>

<p>Katie's face was blank; she had forgotten
the journey.</p>

<p>"You passed Jennie Vance and me in
the Pines," said Dotty, "and went deep
into the woods, and a bee stung you."</p>

<p>"O, now I 'member," said Katie, suddenly.
"I 'member the bee as plain as 'tever
'twas!" And she curled her lip with contempt
for that small Flyaway, of long ago&mdash;that
silly baby who had thought heaven
was on a hill.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> went up on a ladder when I was three
years old," said Prudy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you?" said Flyaway. This was
a consolation. "Well, I was three years
old, too; I didn't know 'bout angels&mdash;didn't
know they had to have wings on."</p>

<p>Here Flyaway curled her lip again and
smiled.</p>

<p>"You are wiser now," sighed Miss Polly.
"You and I won't try to go to heaven till
our time comes&mdash;will we, dear?"</p>

<p>Katie took Miss Polly's large, thin hand,
and measured it beside her own tiny one.</p>

<p>"Miss Polly," said she, with one of her
extremely wise looks, "when you go up
to God you'll be a very little girl!"</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" said Miss Polly, weaving
the third pin into her shawl; "how do
you make that out?"</p>

<p>"Your body'll all be cut off," replied
Katie, making the motion of a pair of scissors
with her fingers; "all be cut right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
straight off; there won't be nuffin' left but
just your little spirit!"</p>

<p>"Since you know so much, dear, how
large is my spirit?"</p>

<p>Katie put her hand on the left side of
the belt of her apron.</p>

<p>"Don't you call that small, right under
my hand a-beatin'?" said she. "'Bout's
big as a bird, Miss Polly. Little round
ball for a head, little mites o' eyes; but
you won't care&mdash;you can see <i>just</i> as well."</p>

<p>"It does beat all where children get such
queer ideas&mdash;doesn't it, Ruth?" said Miss
Whiting.</p>

<p>"Didn't you know it?" cried Katie, finding
she had startled Miss Polly. "Didn't
you know you's goin' to be little, and fly
in the air just so?" throwing up her arms.
"I want to go dreffully, for there's a gold
harp o' music up there, and I'll play on it:
it'll be mine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't feel in a hurry to die, I
hope," said Miss Polly, anxiously.</p>

<p>Katie's eager face clouded. "No," said
she, sorrowfully; "I want to, but I hate
to go up to God and leave my pink dress.
I can't go into it then, I'll be so little."</p>

<p>"You'll be just big enough to go into
the pocket," laughed Dotty.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Miss Polly, gravely; "you
shouldn't joke upon such serious subjects.
Good by, children. Your house is full of
company, and I didn't come to stay. Here's
a bag of thoroughwort I've been picking
for your grandmother; you may give it to
her with my love, and tell her my side is
worse. I shall be in to-morrow."</p>

<p>So saying, Miss Polly went away, seeming
to be wafted out of the room on a
sigh.</p>

<p>The high-chair was brought down from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the attic for Flyaway, who sat in it that
evening at the tea-table, and smiled round
upon her friends in the most benevolent
manner.</p>

<p>"I's growing so big now, mamma," said
she, coaxingly, "don't you spect I must
have some tea?"</p>

<p>Grandmother pleaded for the youngest,
too. "Let me give her some just this
once, Maria."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>white</i> tea, then," returned Mrs.
Clifford, smiling; "and will Flyaway remember
not to ask for it again? Mamma
thinks little girls should drink milk."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, I won't never. She gives it
to me <i>this</i> night, 'cause I's her little <i>grand-girl</i>.
Mayn't Hollis have it too, 'cause he's
her little grand-<i>boy</i>?"</p>

<p>"Cunning as ever, you see," whispered
the admiring Horace to cousin Susy, who
replied, rather indifferently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"No cunninger than our Prudy used to
be."</p>

<p>Flyaway made quick work of drinking
her white tea, and when she came to the
last few drops she swung her cup round
and round, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Didn't you know, Hollis, that's the way
gampa does, when <i>he</i> gets most froo, to
make it sweet?"</p>

<p>No, Horace had not noticed; it was
"Fly, with her little eye," who saw everything,
and made remarks about it.</p>

<p>"O, O," cried Grace, dropping her knife
and fork, and patting her hands softly
under the table, "isn't it so nice to be at
Willowbrook again, taking supper together?
Doesn't it remind you of pleasant
things, Susy, to eat grandma's cream toast?"</p>

<p>"Reminds me," said Susy, after reflecting,
"of jumping on the hay."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Minds me of&mdash;of&mdash;" remarked Flyaway;
and there she fell into a brown
study, with her head swaying from side
to side.</p>

<p>"I don't know why it is," said Prudy,
"but since you spoke, this cream toast
makes me think of the rag-bag. Excuse
me for being impolite, grandma, but where
<i>is</i> the rag-bag?"</p>

<p>"In the back room, dear, where it always
is; and you may wheel it off to-morrow."</p>

<p>It had been Mrs. Parlin's custom, once
or twice every summer, to allow the children
to take the large, heavy rag-bag to
the store, and sell its contents for little
articles, which they divided among themselves.
Sometimes the price of the rags
amounted to half or three quarters of a
dollar, and there was a regular carnival of
figs, candy, and fire-crackers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Horace was so much older now, that
he did not fancy the idea of being seen in
the street, trundling a wheelbarrow; but
he went on with his cream toast and made
no remark.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE RAG-BAG.</h3>


<p>Next morning there was a loud call from
the three Parlins for the rag-bag, in which
Flyaway joined, though she hardly knew
the difference between a rag-bag and a paper
of pins.</p>

<p>"I wish you to understand, girls," said
Horace, flourishing his hat, "that I'm not
going to cart round any such trash for you
this summer."</p>

<p>"Now, Horace!"</p>

<p>"You know, Gracie, you belong to a
Girls' Rights' Society. Do you suppose I
want to interfere with your privileges?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Horace Clifford, you wouldn't see
your own sister trundling a wheelbarrow?"</p>

<p>"O, no; I shan't be there," said Horace,
coolly; "I shan't see you. I promised to
weed the verbena bed for your aunt Louise.
Good by, girls. Success to the rag-bag!"</p>

<p>"Let's catch him!" cried Susy, darting
after her ungallant cousin; but he ran so
fast, and flourished his garden hoe so recklessly,
that she gave up the chase.</p>

<p>"Let him go," said Grace, with a fine-lady
air: "who cares about rag-bags?
We've outgrown that sort of thing, you
and I, Susy; let the little girls have our
share."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure," replied Susy, faintly,
though not without a pang, for she still
retained a childish fondness for jujube paste,
and was not allowed a great abundance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
pocket-money. "Yes, to be sure, let the
<i>little</i> girls have our share."</p>

<p>"Then may we three youngest have the
whole rag-bag?" said Prudy, brightly.
"Dotty, you and I will trundle the wheelbarrow,
and Fly shall go behind."</p>

<p>"What an idea!" exclaimed Grace. "I've
seen little beggar children drawing a dog-cart.
Grandma'll never allow such a thing."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will," said grandma, tying on
her checked apron. "Dog-carts or wheel-barrows,
so they only take care not to be
rude. In a city it is different."</p>

<p>"Yes, grandma," said Dotty, twisting her
front hair joyfully; "but here in the country
they want little girls to have good
times&mdash;don't they? Why don't everybody
move into the country, do you s'pose?
Lots of bare spots round here,&mdash;nothing
on 'em but cows."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, nuffin' but gampa's cows," chimed
in Flyaway, twisting <i>her</i> front hair.</p>

<p>"Louisa," said Mrs. Parlin, "you may
help me about this loaf of 'Maine plum
cake,' and while you are beating the butter
and sugar I will look over the rag-bag.
Dotty, please run for my spectacles."</p>

<p>When Dotty returned with the spectacles,
Jennie Vance came with her, pouting
a little at the cool reception she had met,
and thinking Miss Dimple hardly polite
because she was too much interested in
an old rag-bag to pay proper attention to
visitors.</p>

<p>"Grandma, what makes you pick over
these rags? We can take them just as they
are."</p>

<p>"I always do so, my dear, and for several
reasons. One is, that woollen pieces
may have crept in by mistake.  As we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
profess to sell cotton rags, it would be
dishonest to mix them with woollen."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, I understand," said Jennie, who
often spoke when it was quite as well to
keep silent; "it's always best to be honest&mdash;isn't
it, Mrs. Parlin?"</p>

<p>The rags were spread out upon the table,
giving Flyaway a fine opportunity to scatter
them right and left.</p>

<p>"O, here's a splendid piece of blue ribbon
to make my doll a bonnet," said Dotty.</p>

<p>"That's another reason why she picks
'em over," remarked Jennie; "so she won't
waste things. Only, Dotty, that has got
an awful grease-spot."</p>

<p>"There, children," said Mrs. Parlin, presently,
"I have taken out a card of hooks
and eyes, a flannel bandage, and a shoe-string.
You may have everything else."</p>

<p>Dotty caught her grandmother's arm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
"Please, grandma, don't sweep 'em into
the bag; let us look some more. I've just
found a big Lisle glove; if I can find another,
then Abner can go blackberrying; he
says his hands are ever so tender."</p>

<p>"And you thought he was in earnest,"
said Prudy. "While you are looking,
I'll go into the nursery and finish that
holder."</p>

<p>Flyaway, having climbed upon the table,
had rolled herself into some mosquito netting,
like a caterpillar in a cocoon. They
were all so much interested, that grandma,
in the kindness of her heart, did not like
to disturb them.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to all the treasures
you can find, but as soon as the cake is
made I shall want the table; so be quick,"
said she, looking out from the pantry, where
she was beating eggs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, grandma, we'll hurry; and
may we have every single thing we like
the looks of? now, honest."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dotty."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Parlin and Miss Louise talked
about currants, and citron, and quite forgot
such trifles as rag-bags.</p>

<p>"Here's another big glove," said Dotty,
"not the same color, but no matter; and
here are some saddle-bags, Jennie. I'm
going to be a doctor."</p>

<p>"Saddle-bags, Dotty! those are pockets."
Jennie took them from Miss Dimple's hands.
They were held together by a narrow strip
of brown linen, and had once belonged to
a pair of pantaloons.</p>

<p>"I'm going to see if there isn't something
inside," said Jennie. "Why, yes,
here's a raisin, true's you live. And here,
in the other one,&mdash;O, Dotty!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>But Dotty had run into the nursery to
show Prudy a muslin cap.</p>

<p>"A wad of&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jennie was determined to see what; so
she unrolled it.</p>

<p>"Scrip," cried she, holding up some
greenbacks.</p>

<p>"Skipt," echoed Flyaway, who had come
out of the cocoon and gone into the form
of a mop, her head adorned with cotton
fringe.</p>

<p>Yes; a two dollar bill and a one dollar
bill, as green as lettuce leaves. This was
a great marvel. Columbus was not half
so much surprised when he discovered
America.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Parlin, do you hear?"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Parlin heard nothing, for the
din of the egg-beating drowned both the
shrill little voices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>A sudden idea came to Jennie. Whose
money was this? Mrs. Parlin's? No; hadn't
Mrs. Parlin looked over the rags once,
and said the children might have what was
left? "'You are welcome to all the treasures
you can find;' that was what she
said," repeated Jennie to herself. "I'm the
one that found this treasure,&mdash;not Dotty,
not Flyaway. This is honest, and I do not
lie when I say it."</p>

<p>Jennie began to tremble, and a hot color
flew into her cheeks, and added new lustre
to her black eyes. "If I could only make
Flyaway forget it," thought she, with a
whirling sensation of anger towards the innocent
child, who knew no better than to
proclaim aloud every piece of news she
heard. "I'll make her forget it." Jenny
hastily concealed the money in the neck of
her dress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where's that skipt? that skipt?" said
Flyaway.</p>

<p>"Fly Clifford," said Jennie, severely,
"you've climbed on the table! Just think
of it! Your grandmother doesn't allow
you on her table. What made you get up
here."</p>

<p>"'Cause," replied Flyaway, seizing the
kitty by the tail, and thrusting her into a
cabbage-net, "'cause I fought best."</p>

<p>"But you must get right down, this
minute."</p>

<p>"No," said Flyaway, shaking her head-dress
of white fringe with great solemnity;
"I isn't goin' to get down."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you must."</p>

<p>Flyaway opened and shut her eyes slowly,
in token of deep displeasure. "I don't
never 'low little girls to scold to me," said
she. "You'd better call grandma; 'haps
<i>she</i> can make me get down."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not Jennie's purpose to wait
for that; she seized the little one roughly
by the arms, pulled her from the table,
and hurried her into the parlor.</p>

<p>Flyaway was indignant. "Does you&mdash;feel
happy?" said she, with a reproachful
glance at Jennie.</p>

<p>"There, look out of the window, Flyaway,
darling, and watch to see if Horace
isn't coming in from the garden."</p>

<p>"Can't Hollis come, 'thout me watching
him?" returned Flyaway, winking slowly
again, for her sweet little soul was stirred
with wrath. The memory of the "skipt"
had indeed been driven away, and she could
only think,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Isn't Jennie so easy fretted! I wasn't
doin' nuffin'; and then she jumped me right
down. Unpolite gell! that's one thing."</p>

<p>And Jennie was thinking, "She nev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>er'll
remember the money now, or, if she
does, I don't believe Mrs. Parlin will pay
any attention to what she says." Jennie
was still very much excited, and wondered
why she trembled so.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to keep it unless it's perfectly
proper," thought she; "I guess I
know the eighth commandment fast enough.
I shan't keep it unless Dotty thinks best.
I'll tell her, and see what she says."</p>

<p>Jennie had often pilfered little things
from her mother's cupboard, such as cake
and raisins; but a piece of money of the
most trifling value she had never thought
of taking before.</p>

<p>Leaving Flyaway busy with block houses,
she ran to the nursery door, and motioned
with her finger for Dotty to come out.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Dotty, when they
were both shut into the china closet;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
"don't you want my sister Prudy to
know?"</p>

<p>Jennie replied, in a great flutter, "No,
no, no. You musn't tell a single soul,
Dotty Dimple, as long as you live, and
I'll give you half."</p>

<p>"Half what?"</p>

<p>Jennie produced the money from her
bosom, feeling, I am glad to say, very
guilty. "Out o' those saddle-bag pockets
out there," added she, breathlessly; "true's
the world."</p>

<p>"Why, Jennie Vance!"</p>

<p>"One had a raisin in and a button, and
nobody but me would have thought of looking.
You wouldn't&mdash;now would you? My
father says I've got such sharp eyes!"</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Dotty, who considered her
own eyes as bright as any diamonds; "you
took the saddle-bag right out of my hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
How do you know I shouldn't have peeked
in?"</p>

<p>Jennie did not reply, but smoothed out
the wrinkled notes with many a loving pat.</p>

<p>"What did grandma say?" asked Dotty;
"wasn't she pleased?"</p>

<p>"Your grandmother doesn't know anything
about it, Dotty Dimple; what business
is it to her?"</p>

<p>Jennie's tone was defiant. She assumed
a courage she was far from feeling.</p>

<p>Dotty was speechless with surprise, but
her eyes grew as round as soap-bubbles.</p>

<p>"The pockets don't belong to her, Dotty,
and never did. They never came out of
any of her dresses&mdash;now did they?"</p>

<p>Dotty's eyes swelled like a couple of bubbles
ready to burst.</p>

<p>"Jennie Vance, I didn't know you's a
thief."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"You stop talking so, Dotty. She was
going to sweep everything into the rag-bag&mdash;now
wasn't she? And this money
would have gone in too, if it hadn't been
for my sharp eyes&mdash;now wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"But it isn't yours, Jennie Vance&mdash;because
it don't belong to you."</p>

<p>"Now, Dotty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You go right off, Jennie Vance, and
carry it to my grandma this minute."</p>

<p>The tone of command irritated Jennie.
She had not felt at all decided about keeping
the money, but opposition gave her
courage. Her temper and Dotty's were
always meeting and striking fire.</p>

<p>"It isn't your grandma's pockets, Miss
Parlin. If it was the last word I was to
speak, it isn't your grandmother's pockets!"</p>

<p>"Jane Sidney Vance!"</p>

<p>"You needn't call me by my middle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
name, and stare so at me, Dotty Dimple.
I was going to give you half!"</p>

<p>"What do I want of half, when it isn't
yours to give?" said Dotty, gazing regretfully
at the money, nevertheless. Three
dollars! Why, it was a small fortune!
If it only did really belong to Jenny!</p>

<p>"Your grandmother said everything we
liked the looks of, Dotty. Don't you like
the looks of this?"</p>

<p>"But you know, Jennie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, you needn't preach to me. You
wasn't the one that found it. If I'd truly
been a thief, or if I hadn't been a thief,
it would have been right for me to keep
it, and perfectly proper, and not said a
word to you, either; so there."</p>

<p>"Jennie Vance, I'm going right out of
this closet, and tell my grandma what you've
said."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait, Dotty Dimple; let me get through
talking. I meant to buy things for your
grandmother with it. O, yes, I did&mdash;a
silk dress, and cap, and shoes."</p>

<p>Dotty twirled her hair, and looked
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Of course I did. Wouldn't it surprise
her, when she wasn't expecting it? And
Flyaway, too,&mdash;something for her. We
wouldn't keep anything for ourselves, only
just enough to buy clothes and such things
as we really need."</p>

<p>Before Dotty had time to reply there
was a loud scream from the parlor.</p>

<p>"Fly is killed&mdash;she is killed!" cried
Dotty; but Jennie had presence of mind
enough to tuck the bills into the neck of
her dress.</p>

<p>"Don't you tell anybody a word about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
it, Dotty.  If you tell I'll do something
awful to you. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Dotty heard, but did not answer. The
fate of her cousin Flyaway seemed more
important to her just then than all the
bank-bills in the world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE WICKED GIRL.</h3>


<p>Flyaway had only been climbing the
outside of the staircase, and would have
done very well, if some one had not rung
the door-bell, and startled her so that she
fell from the very top stair to the floor.
It was feared, at first, that several bones
were broken and her intellect injured for
life; but after crying fifteen minutes, she
seemed to feel nearly as well as before.</p>

<p>"If ever a child was made of thistle-down
it is Flyaway Clifford," said aunt Louise.</p>

<p>Still it was not thought best for her to
fatigue herself that day by selling rags,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and the wheelbarrow enterprise was put off
until the next morning.</p>

<p>The person who rang the door-bell was
Mrs. Vance's girl Susan, who called for
Jennie to go home and try on a frock.
Jennie did not return, and Dotty had a
sense of uneasiness all day. The guilty
secret of the three dollars weighed upon
her mind. Should she, or should she not,
tell her grandmother?</p>

<p>"I don't know but Jennie would do
something to my things if I told," thought
she; "but then I never promised a word.
Here it is four o'clock. Who knows but
she's gone and spent that money, and my
grandmother never'll know what's 'come of
it?"</p>

<p>This possibility was very alarming. "Jennie
Vance doesn't seem to have any little
whisper inside of <i>her</i> heart, that ticks like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a watch; but <i>I</i> have. <i>My</i> conscience pricks;
so I know that perhaps it's my duty to go
and tell."</p>

<p>Dotty drew herself up virtuously and
looked in the glass. There she seemed to
see an angelic little girl, whose only wish
was to do just right&mdash;a little girl as much
purer than Jennie Vance, as a lily is purer
than a very ugly toadstool.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Dotty, there is some truth
in the picture. Jennie is not a good child;
but neither are you an angel. There is
more wickedness in your proud little heart
than you will ever begin to find out. And
wait a minute. Who teaches you all you
know of right and wrong? Is it your
mother? Suppose she had died, as did
Jennie's mamma, when you were a toddling
baby?</p>

<p>There, that's all; you do not hear a word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
I say; and if you did, you would not heed,
O, self-righteous Dotty Dimple!</p>

<p>Dotty ran up stairs to find her grandmother.</p>

<p>"Grandma," whispered she, though there
was no one else in the room; "something
dreadful has happened. You've lost three
dollars!"</p>

<p>"What, dear?"</p>

<p>"O, you needn't look in your pocket.
Jennie found 'em in the rag-bag, and tried
to make me take half; but of course I
never; and now she's run off with 'em!"</p>

<p>"Found three dollars in the rag-bag?
I guess not."</p>

<p>"Yes, grandma; for I saw her just as
she was going to find em', in a pair of
pockets. I should have seen 'em myself
if she hadn't looked first."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Is this really so? But she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
ought to have come and given them to
me."</p>

<p>"That was just what I told her, over
and over, grandma, and over again. But
she's a dreadful naughty girl, Jennie Vance
is. If there's anything bad she can do,
she goes right off and does it."</p>

<p>"Hush, my child."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, I won't say any more, <i>only</i> I
don't think my mother would like to have
me play with little girls that take money
out of rag-bags."</p>

<p>Dotty drew herself up again in a very
stately way.</p>

<p>"Jennie <i>said</i> she was going to buy you
a silk dress and so forth; but she does
truly lie so, 'one to another,' that you can't
believe her for certain, not half she says."</p>

<p>Grandma looked over her spectacles and
through the window, as if trying to see
what ought to be done.</p>

<p>"You did right to tell me this, my
child," said she; "but I wish you to say
nothing about it to any one else: will you
remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," replied Dotty, trying to read
her grandmother's face, and feeling a little
alarmed by its solemnity. "What you
going to do, grandma? Not put Jennie
in the lockup&mdash;are you? 'Cause if you
do&mdash;O, don't you! She said 'twas her
sharp eyes, and she didn't mean to steal,
and 'twasn't your pockets, and she promised
she'd give me half&mdash;yes, she truly
did, grandma."</p>

<p>"Go, dear, and bring me my bonnet
from the band-box in my bed-room closet."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Parlin folded the sheet she
was making, put on her best shawl and
bonnet, and kid gloves, and taking her
sun umbrella, set out for a walk. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was a look in her face which made her
little granddaughter think it would not be
proper to ask any questions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin met Jennie Vance coming
in at the gate.</p>

<p>"O, dear," thought Dotty, "I don't want
to see her. Grandma says I've done right,
but Jennie'll call me a tell-tale. I'll go
out in the barn and hide."</p>

<p>The guilty secret had lain heavy at Jennie's
heart all day. As soon as her dress-maker
could spare her, and a troublesome
little cousin had left, she asked permission
to go to Mrs. Parlin's.</p>

<p>"Dotty thinks I meant to keep it," she
thought. "I never did see such a girl.
You can't say the least little thing but
she takes it sober earnest, and says she'll
tell her grandmother."</p>

<p>Jennie stole round by the back door,
and timidly asked for Miss Dimple.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know where she is,"
answered Ruthie, with a pleasant smile;
"nor Flyaway either. I have been living
in peace for half an hour."</p>

<p>Ruthie made you think of lemon candy;
she was sweet and tart too.</p>

<p>While Jennie, with the kind assistance
of Prudy, was hunting for Dotty, Mrs.
Parlin was in Judge Vance's parlor, talking
with Jennie's step-mother. Mrs. Vance
was shocked to hear of her daughter's conduct,
for she loved her and wished her to
do right.</p>

<p>"My poor Jennie," said she; "from her
little babyhood until she was six years old,
there was no one to take care of her but
a hired nurse, who neglected her sadly."</p>

<p>"I know just what sort of training Jennie
has had from Serena Pond," said Mrs.
Parlin; "it was most unfortunate. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
you are so faithful with her, my dear Mrs.
Vance, that I do believe she will outgrow
all those early influences."</p>

<p>"I keep hoping so," said Mrs. Vance,
repressing a sigh; "I take it very kindly
of you, Mrs. Parlin, that you should come
to me with this affair. I shall not allow
Jennie to go to your house very often.
You do not like to wound my feelings,
but I am sure you cannot wish to have
your little granddaughter very intimate
with a child who is sly and untruthful."</p>

<p>"My dear lady," said grandma Parlin,
taking Mrs. Vance's hand, and pressing it
warmly; "since we are talking so freely
together, and I know you are too generous
to be offended, I will confess to you that
if Jennie persists in concealing this money,
I would prefer not to have Dotty play with
her very much; at least while her mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
is not here to have the care of her." It
was hard for Mrs. Parlin to say this, and
she added presently,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please let Jennie spend the night at
our house. She may wish to talk with me;
we will give her the opportunity."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vance gladly consented. She had
observed that Jennie seemed unhappy, and
was very anxious to see Dotty again. She
hoped she had gone to return the money
of her own free will.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Parlin opened the nursery
door at home, she found Jennie building
block houses, to Flyaway's great delight,
while at the other end of the room sat
Dotty Dimple, resolutely sewing patchwork.</p>

<p>"O, grandma," spoke up Flyaway, "Jennie
came to see me; she didn't come to
see Dotty, 'cause Dotty don't want to talk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
There, now, Jennie, make a rat to put in
the cupboard. R goes first to rat."</p>

<p>Innocent little Flyaway! She had long
ago forgotten her pique against Jennie for
being "so easy fretted," and jumping her
down from the table.</p>

<p>Wretched little Jennie! The new blue
and white frock, just finished by her dress-maker,
covered a heart filled with mortification.
Dotty Dimple would not talk to
her. It seemed as if Dotty had climbed
to the top of a high mountain, and was
looking down, down upon her.</p>

<p>Dotty did feel very exalted to-day; but
there was another reason why she would
not talk with Jennie: she might have to
confess that grandma knew about the
money; and then what a scene there would
be! So Dotty set her lips together, and
sewed as if she was afraid somebody would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
freeze to death before she could finish her
patchwork quilt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford, who did not understand
the cause of Dotty's lofty mood, took pity
on Jennie, and tried to amuse her. After
a while, Dotty came softly along, and sat
down close to her aunt Maria, ready to
listen to the story of the "Pappoose,"
though she had heard it fifty times before.</p>

<p>She did not see Jennie alone for one
moment. Grandma Parlin did. "Jennie,"
said she, taking her into the parlor to show
her a new shell, "are you going with our
little girls, to-morrow, to sell rags?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, ma'am, I'm sure," replied
Jennie, looking hard at the sofa. She
longed to make an open confession, and
get rid of the troublesome money, but had
not the courage to do it without some help
from Dotty.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>"O, dear," thought she, "I feel just as
wicked with that money in my bosom!
Seems as if she could hear it crumple. If
Dotty would only let me talk to her first!"</p>

<p>But Dotty continued as unapproachable
as the Pope of Rome. Eight o'clock came,
and the two unhappy little girls went
slowly up stairs to bed. Dotty, in her
lofty pride, tried to make her little friend
feel herself a sinner; while Jennie, ready
to hide herself in the potato-bin for
shame, was, at the same time, very angry
with the self-satisfied Miss Dimple. She
was awed by her superior goodness, but
did not love her any the better for it.
Why should she? Dotty's goodness lacked</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Humility</i>, that low, sweet root,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which all heavenly virtues shoot."
</div></div>

<p>"Here, Miss Parlin," said Jennie, angri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>ly,
as she took off her dress; "here it is,
right in my neck. I should have gone and
given it to your grandmother, ever so long
ago, if you hadn't acted so!"</p>

<p>Dotty pulled off her stockings.</p>

<p>"I 'spose you thought I was going to
keep it. Here, take your old money!"</p>

<p>"You did mean to keep it, Jane Sidney
Vance," retorted Dotty, as fierce as a thistle;
and finished undressing at the top of
her speed.</p>

<p>The money lay on the floor, and neither
of the proud girls would pick it up. Jennie,
who always prayed at her mother's knee,
forgot her prayer to-night, and climbed
into bed without it. But Dotty, feeling
more than ever how much better she was
than her little friend, knelt beside a chair,
and prayed in a loud voice. First, she
repeated the "Lord's Prayer," then "Gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>tle
Jesus, meek and mild," and "Now I
lay me down to sleep." She was not talking
to her heavenly Father, but to Jennie,
and ended her petitions thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O God, forgive me if I have done
anything naughty to-day; and please forgive
<i>Jennie Vance, the wickedest girl in
this town</i>."</p>

<p>Then the little Pharisee got into bed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>"WHEELBARROWING."</h3>


<p>"The wickedest girl in this town!" Jennie's
eyes flashed in the dark like a couple
of fireflies. At first she was too angry
to speak; and when words did come, they
were too weak. She wanted words that
were so strong, and bitter, and fierce, that
they would make Dotty quail. But all
she could say was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, dreadful good you are, Miss Parlin!
Good's the minister! Ah! guess I'll get
out and sleep on the floor!"</p>

<p>Dotty made no reply, but rolled over
to the front of the bed, and Jennie pushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
herself to the back of it. There the little
creatures lay in silence, each on an edge
of the bedstead, and a whole mattress
between. Sleep did not come at once.</p>

<p>"She's left that money on the floor,"
thought Dotty; "what if a mouse should
creep down the chimney, and gnaw it all
up? But she must take care of it herself.
<i>I</i> shan't!"</p>

<p>And Jennie thought, wrathfully, "Dotty
says such long prayers she can't stop to
pick up that scrip! If she expects me to
get out of bed, she's made a mistake; I
won't touch her old money."</p>

<p>About nine o'clock grandma Parlin came
quietly into the room with a lamp. A
smile crept round the corners of her mouth,
as she saw the little girls sleeping so
widely apart, their faces turned away from
each other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"How is this?" said she, as the two
bills caught her eye. "Of all the foolish
children! Dropping money about the room
like waste paper!"</p>

<p>The light awoke Jennie, who had only
just fallen asleep. "Now is the time,"
said she to herself; and without waiting
for a second thought, which would have
been a worse one, she sprang out of bed,
and caught Mrs. Parlin by the skirts.</p>

<p>"That money is yours, Mrs. Parlin,"
said she, bravely. "Yours; I found it
in the rag-bag. Something naughty came
into me this morning, and made me want to
keep it; but I'm ever so sorry, and never'll
do it again. Will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>Then grandma Parlin seated herself in
a rocking-chair, took Jennie right into her
lap, and talked to her a long while in the
sweetest way. Jennie curled her head into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the good woman's neck, and sobbed out
all her wretchedness.</p>

<p>"She knew she was real bad, and people
didn't like to have her play with their
little girls, and Dotty Dimple thought she
was awful; but <i>was</i> she the wickedest girl
in this town?"</p>

<p>"No; O, no!"</p>

<p>"Wasn't Dotty some bad, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dotty often did wrong."</p>

<p>Then Jenny wept afresh.</p>

<p>"She knew she <i>was</i> worse than Dotty,
though. She wished,&mdash;O, dear, as true
as she lived,&mdash;she wished she was dead
and buried, and drowned in the Red Sea,
and the grass over her grave, and shut
up in jail, and everything else."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Parlin soothed her with kind
words, but told the truth with every one.</p>

<p>"No 'm," Jennie said; "it wasn't right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to take fruit-cake without leave, or tell
wrong stories either; she wouldn't any
more. Yes'm, she would try to be good&mdash;she
never had tried much.&mdash;Yes 'm,
she would ask God to help her. Should
you suppose He would do it?</p>

<p>"Yes 'm, she would ask Him not to
let her have much temptation. She did
believe she would rather be a good girl&mdash;a
real good girl, like Prudy, <i>not like Dotty</i>!&mdash;than
to have a velvet dress with
spangles all over it."</p>

<p>All this while Dotty did not waken. In
the morning she was surprised to see her
little bedfellow looking so cheerful.</p>

<p>"I've told your grandmother all about
it," said Jennie with a smile. "I knew I
did wrong, but I don't believe I should
have meant to if you hadn't acted so your
<i>own</i> self&mdash;now that's a fact."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't seen my grandmother,"
returned Dotty, not noticing the last clause
of her friend's remark. "You dreamed it."</p>

<p>"No, she came in here and forgave me.
She's the best woman in this world. What
do you think she said about you, Dotty
Dimple? She said there were other little
girls full as good as you are.  There!"</p>

<p>"O!"</p>

<p>"Said you 'often did wrong,' that's <i>just</i>
what," added Jennie, correcting herself,
and making sure of the "white truth."</p>

<p>Step by step Dotty came down from the
mountain-top, and, before breakfast was
ready, had led her visitor through the
morning dew to the playhouse under the
trees, chatting all the way as if nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>It proved that the money belonged to
Abner.  He had missed it several weeks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
before, and ever since that had been suspecting
old Daniel McQuilken, a day laborer,
of stealing it.</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed of it now," said Abner to
Ruth, "though I didn't tell anybody but
you. I wish you'd mix a pitcher of sweetened
water, and let me take it out to the
field to old Daniel. I feel as if I wanted
to make it up to him some way."</p>

<p>Ruth laughed; and when Abner came
into the house at ten o'clock, she had a
pitcher of molasses and water ready for
him, also a plate of cherry turnovers.
Flyaway insisted upon toddling over the
ground with one of the turnovers in her
apron.</p>

<p>"Man," said she, when they reached the
field, and she saw the Irishman with his
funny red and white hair, "what's your
name, man?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>He wiped his face with his checked
shirt-sleeve, and took a turnover from her
hand, bowing very low as he did so.</p>

<p>"Thank ee, my little lady; sense you're
plazed to ask me,&mdash;my name's Dannul."</p>

<p>"O, are you?" said Flyaway, looking
up in surprise at the large and oddly-dressed
stranger. "Are you Daniel? My
mamma's just been reading about you.
You was in the lions' den&mdash;<i>wasn't</i> you,
Daniel?"</p>

<p>Mr. McQuilken smiled at bareheaded,
flossy-haired little Katie, and replied, with
a wink at Abner,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fath, little lady, and I suppose I'm
that same Dannul; but 'twas so long ago
I've clane forgot aboot it entirely."</p>

<p>"O, did you? Well, you <i>was</i> in the
lions' den, Daniel, but they didn't bite
you, you know, 'cause you prayed so long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and so loud, with your winners up; and
then God wouldn't let 'em bite."</p>

<p>Old Daniel laid both his huge hands
on Katie's head.</p>

<p>"Swate little chirrub," said he, "don't
she look saintish?"</p>

<p>Katie moved away; she did not like to
have her hair pulled, and Daniel was unconsciously
drawing it through the big
cracks in his fingers, as if he was waxing
silk.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go home now," said she,
with a timid glance at the man whom the
lions did not bite; "they'll be spectin'
me."</p>

<p>Abner and Daniel both watched the tiny
figure across the fields till Ruth came out
to meet it, and it fluttered into the east
door of the house.</p>

<p>"There, she's safe," said Abner; "she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
needs as much looking after as a young
turkey."</p>

<p>"She runs like a little sperrit, bliss her
swate eyes," said Daniel. "I had one as
pooty as her, but she's at Mary's fate,
Hivven rist her sowl!"</p>

<p>The moment Flyaway reached the house,
she rushed into the parlor to tell her
mother the news.</p>

<p>"The man you readed about in the
book, mamma, he's out there! Daniel,
that the lions didn't bite, mamma, 'cause
he prayed so long and so loud with his
winners up; he's out there&mdash;got a hat on."</p>

<p>"O, no, my child; it is thousands of
years since Daniel was in the lions' den;
he died long and long ago."</p>

<p>"But he said he did, mamma; he told
me so. I <i>fought</i> he was dead, mamma,
but he said he wasn't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford shook her head. "I dare
say his name is Daniel, but he was never
in a lion's den."</p>

<p>Flyaway opened and closed her eyes in
the slowest and most impressive manner.
"Mamma," said she, solemnly, "does&mdash;folks&mdash;tell&mdash;lies?"</p>

<p>It was an entirely now idea to the innocent
child: it stamped itself upon her
mind like a motto on warm sealing-wax,
"Folks&mdash;does&mdash;tell&mdash;lies."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford was sorry to see the look
of distrust on the young face.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, little Flyaway. I think
the man was in sport; he was only playing
with you, as Horace does sometimes, when
he calls himself your horse."</p>

<p>Flyaway said no more, but she pressed
her eyelids together again, and felt that
she had been trifled with. Half an hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
afterwards Prudy heard her repeating,
slowly, to herself, "Folks&mdash;does&mdash;tell&mdash;lies."</p>

<p>"Why, here she is," called Dotty from
the piazza; "come, Fly; we're going wheel-barrowing."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, cousin Dotty," said
Mrs. Clifford; "Flyaway must put on a
clean frock; she is not coming home with
you, but you are to leave her at aunt
Martha's. I shall meet her there at dinner
time."</p>

<p>"O, mamma, may I? I love you a hundred
rooms full. Let me go bring my
<i>buttoner bootner</i> quick's a minute."</p>

<p>Flyaway was not long in getting ready.
She was never long about anything.</p>

<p>"You said we might have all the money,
we three&mdash;didn't you, grandma?" asked
Dotty again, at the last moment, thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
how glad she was Jennie had gone home,
and would not claim a share.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied patient grandma for the
fifth time; "you may do anything you like
with it, except to buy colored candy."</p>

<p>As they were trundling the wheelbarrow
out of the yard, Horace came up from the
garden.</p>

<p>"Prudy," said he, with rather a shame-faced
glance at his favorite cousin, "you
girls will cut a pretty figure, parading
through the streets like a gang of pedlers.
Come, let me be the driver."</p>

<p>"O, we thought you couldn't leave your
flower-beds, sir," replied Prudy, sweeping
a courtesy.</p>

<p>"Well, the weeds <i>are</i> pretty tough,
ma'am; roots 'way down in China, and the
Emperor objects to parting with 'em;
but&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poh! we don't need any boys," cried
the self-sustained Miss Dimple; "if your
hands are too soft, Prudy, you mustn't
push. Wait and see what Dotty Dimple
can do."</p>

<p>"O, then, if you spurn me and my offer,
good by. I suppose my little Topknot
goes for <i>surplusage</i>," said Horace, who
liked now and then to puzzle Dotty with
a new word. He meant that Flyaway was
of no use, but rather in the way.</p>

<p>"No, she needn't do any such thing,"
returned Dotty. "Jump in, Fly, and sit
on the bag." And off moved the gay little
party, "the middle-aged sister" laughing
so she could hardly push, Flyaway dancing
up and down on the rag-bag, like a humming-bird
balancing itself on a twig; Grace
and Susy looking down from the "green
chamber" window, and saying to each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
other, with wounded family pride, "<i>Should</i>
you think grandma would allow it?" Out
in the street the young rag-merchants were
greeted by a cow lowing dismally. Flyaway,
in her rustic carriage, felt as secure
as the fabled "kid on the roof of a house;"
so she called out, "Don't cry, old cow; I
'shamed o' you."</p>

<p>At this Prudy and Dotty laughed harder
than ever.</p>

<p>"'Sh right up, old cow," said Flyaway,
standing on her "tipsy-toes," and making
a threatening gesture with her little arms;
"'Sh right up!&mdash;O, why don't that cow
mind in a minute?"</p>

<p>In her earnestness the little girl pushed
the bag to one side, and Prudy and Dotty,
shaking with laughter, tipped over the
wheelbarrow. No harm was done except
to give Flyaway a dust-bath in her nice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
clean frock. Just as they were struggling
with the bag, to get it in again, they were
overtaken by a droll-looking equipage. It
was a long house on wheels, and instantly
reminded Dotty of Noah's ark.</p>

<p>"O, a house a-ridin'! a house a-ridin'!"
exclaimed Flyaway, gazing after it with
the greatest astonishment.</p>

<p>Dotty thought the world was going topsy-turvy.
She looked at the trees to see if
they stood fast in the ground. But Prudy
explained it as soon as she could stop
laughing.</p>

<p>"Only a photograph saloon," said she.
"Didn't you ever see one before? We
don't have them in the city going round
so, but things are different in the country.
Let's watch and see where it stops."</p>

<p>"O, dear me," said Dotty; "I shouldn't
want to live in a house that couldn't stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
still! Stove tipping over, and the gingerbread
falling out of the oven! There, I
declare!"</p>

<p>The look of wonder on Dotty's face was
so amusing that Prudy was obliged to
hold on to her sides.</p>

<p>"There, look!" said she; "it has stopped
down by the corner. Now the man can
bake his gingerbread if he wants to, and
the stove won't tip over. Jump in, Flyaway,
and finish your ride."</p>

<p>"No-o," said Flyaway, wavering between
her fear of the cow, some yards ahead,
and her fear of the rocking, unsteady
wheelbarrow. "Guess I won't get in no
more, Prudy; it wearies me."</p>

<p>"Wearies you?"</p>

<p>"Yes: don't you know what 'wearies'
means, Prudy? It means it makes me a&mdash;a&mdash;little&mdash;scared!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>And in her "weariness" Flyaway nestled
between her two cousins, and kept fast
hold of their skirts till the cow was safely
passed and the red store reached.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" exclaimed Mr. Bradley, the
merchant, as he came out and dragged the
rag-bag into the store; "so you've taken
the business into your own hands, my little
women? Ah, this is a progressive
age! Walk in&mdash;walk in."</p>

<p>Prudy blushed, Dotty smiled, and Flyaway
took off her hat, as she usually did
when she did not know what else to do.</p>

<p>"Take some seats, young ladies," said
Mr. Bradley, placing three chairs in a row,
and bowing as if to the most distinguished
visitors. Two or three men, who were
lounging about the counter, looked on with
a smile. Dotty was very well satisfied,
for she enjoyed attention; but Prudy, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
was older, and had a more delicate sense
of propriety, blushed and cast down her
eyes. She had thought nothing of driving
a wheelbarrow through the street, but now,
for the first time, a feeling of mortification
came over her. If Mr. Bradley would
only keep quiet!</p>

<p>"A fine morning, my young friends!
Rather warm, to be sure. And so you
have brought rags to sell? Would you
like the money for them, or do you think
we can make a trade with some articles
out of the store?"</p>

<p>"Grandma said we could have the money
between us, we three," replied Dotty, with
refreshing frankness, "and buy anything we
please except red and yellow candy."</p>

<p>"I want a <i>music</i>," said Flyaway, in an
eager whisper; "a music, and a ollinge,
and a pig."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush!" said Prudy, for the man with
a piece of court-plaster on his cheek was
certainly laughing.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradley took the bag into another
room to weigh it. A boy was in there,
drawing molasses. "James," said Mr. Bradley,
"run down cellar, and bring up some
beer for these young ladies."</p>

<p>There was a smile on James's face as he
drove the plug into the barrel. Prudy
saw it through the open door, and it went
to her heart. The cream beer was excellent,
but Prudy did not relish it. She and
Dotty had been whispering together.</p>

<p>"We will take two thirds of the rags in
money, if you please," said Prudy, in such
a low tone that Mr. Bradley had to bend
his ear to hear.</p>

<p>"Because," added Dotty, who wished to
have everything clearly explained, "because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
we want to have our tin-types taken, sir.
We saw a saloon riding on wheels, and we
thought we'd go there, and see if the man
wasn't ready to take pictures."</p>

<p>"And our little cousin may use her third,
and buy something out of the store, if you
please," said the blushing Prudy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>TIN-TYPES.</h3>


<p>Mr. Bradley said he did not often allow
any one behind his counter, as all the boys
in the village could testify; but these
young ladies were welcome in any part of
the store.</p>

<p>"That little one is the spryest child I
ever saw," said the man with the court-plaster,
as Flyaway hovered about the candy-jars,
like a butterfly over a flower-bed.
"She isn't a Yankee child&mdash;is she?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Dotty, quickly; "she
is a <i>westerness</i>."</p>

<p>She had heard Horace use the word,
and presumed it was correct.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do wish Dotty would be more afraid
of strangers," thought Prudy. "I never
will take her anywhere again&mdash;with a
wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>Flyaway fluttered around for a minute,
and then alighted upon her favorite sweet-meats,
"<i>pepnits</i>." She chose for her portion
a large amount of these, an harmonica,
and a sugar pig, which Dotty assured her
was not "colored." "Nothing but pink dots,
and those you can pick off."</p>

<p>"The rags came to seventy-five cents, and
this young lady has now had her third;
here is the remainder," said Mr. Bradley,
smiling as he gave each of the little Parlins
some money, and bowed them out of
the store.</p>

<p>"I'll put it in <i>my</i> porte-monnaie, sir;
my sister Prudy didn't bring hers."</p>

<p>"What makes you talk so much, Dotty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Dimple?" said Prudy, "that man has been
making sport of us all the time."</p>

<p>"Did he?" said Dotty, solemnly. "I'm
'stonished at grandma Parlin letting us sell
rags! Wish this wheelbarrow was in the
<i>Stiftic Ocean</i>."</p>

<p>"But it isn't, little sister, and the worst
of it is, we've got to take it to the photograph
saloon; it's so far home and back
again."</p>

<p>"Got to take the ole <i>wheelbarrel</i> every
single where we go," pouted Flyaway, as
drearily as either of her cousins.</p>

<p>"You needn't mind it, though," said
Dotty, giving the one-wheeled coach a hard
push; "a little girl that's going visiting,
and have succotash for dinner."</p>

<p>"I didn't know I was. O, I <i>am</i> so glad!
What is it!"</p>

<p>"Corn and beans. Aunt Martha's girl is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the best cook,&mdash;makes cherry pudding.
Dear, dear, dear! Wish I was in Portland;
see 'f I wouldn't go to Tate Penny's,
and have some salmon and ice-cream!"</p>

<p>Down the beautiful shaded street walked
the three little rag-pedlers; and it did
seem as if they were met by all the people
in town, from the minister down to the
barefoot boys going fishing. At last they
arrived at the house on wheels.</p>

<p>"Now I'll tell you, Fly, what we're going
to do," said Prudy. "Dotty and I
want to have our tin-types taken, to give
to grandma, as a pleasant surprise. We'll
pay for yours too, if you'll sit for it."</p>

<p>"<i>Tin-tybe</i>? Of course, indeed I will.
Won't I have nuffin to do but just sit
still? But I'd rather be gentle (generous),
and give it to my mamma."</p>

<p>"Well, to your mamma, then. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
will be the harm, Dotty, in leaving this
wheelbarrow out here at the door?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Dotty; "I hope
there won't any 'bugglers' come along,
and steal it."</p>

<p>"I shall watch it," replied Prudy, with
a care-worn look; and they all went up
the steps and entered the little picture-gallery.</p>

<p>The windows were closed, and the odor of
chemicals was so stifling, that the children
almost gasped for breath. The artist seemed
glad to see them, made no remarks about
the wheelbarrow, though he must have noticed
it, and said he would be ready in
a few minutes. While they waited, they
walked about the room, looking at the
pictures on the walls.</p>

<p>"See," said Dotty; "there is Abby Grant,
with her hair frizzed. Prudy" (in a low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
whisper), "you don't s'pose he will carry
us off&mdash;do you? I forgot about the wheels,
or I wouldn't have come! O, see that
little boy; hands as big as my father's!
Here comes Jennie Vance; I'm going to
call her in."</p>

<p>Dotty had forgotten her contempt for
her lively friend. Jennie came in, twirling
the rim of her hat, and looking quite gratified
by this mark of friendship in Dotty.</p>

<p>"Going to have your picture taken, Dotty
Dimple? Well, so I would if I was as
pretty as you are. O, dear" (with a sly
peep at the glass), "I wish I wasn't so
homely."</p>

<p>Now Jennie was a handsome child, and
knew it well; but Dotty took her wail in
earnest. "Why, Jennie," said she, with
ready sympathy, "I don't think you're so
<i>very</i> homely; not half so homely, any
way, as some of the girls at Portland."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Jennie frowned and bit her thumb. Prudy
smiled  "behind her mouth," but Dotty
was serenely unconscious that she had
given offence. By this time the artist was
ready, and thought it best to try Flyaway
first; for he had had enough experience
with children to see at a glance that this
one would be as difficult to "take" as a
bird on the wing. Prudy made sure the
wheelbarrow was safe, and then turned to
arrange her little cousin.</p>

<p>"Here, put your hands down in your
lap."</p>

<p>Up went the little hands to the flossy
hair. "It won't stay, Prudy, <i>or nelse</i> you
tie it."</p>

<p>"I shall brush it, the very last minute,
Flyaway. All you must do is sit still.
Mayn't she look at your watch, sir, just
to keep her eyes from moving?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"No matter what she looks at," replied
the artist; "but she must keep that little
head of hers straight."</p>

<p>His tone was firm; he hoped to awe
her into quietness. Flyaway was frightened,
and clung to Prudy for protection.
"Don't the gemplum love little gee&mdash;urls?"
said she, in a voice as low and sad as a
dying dove's.</p>

<p>Mr. Poindexter laughed, and stroked the
beautiful floss lovingly.</p>

<p>"Just turn your sweet little face this
way, dear child; that's all."</p>

<p>"O, my shole! Must I turn my face to
my back!" said Flyaway, bewildered.</p>

<p>"No, no; look at this picture on the
wall. See what it is, so you can tell your
mother."</p>

<p>"It's a bridge, and a man, and a fish,"
said Flyaway, flashing a glance at it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, smooth your forehead; now you
will do." And so she did, for two seconds,
till she began to squint, to see whether it
was a fish or a dog; and that picture was
spoiled.</p>

<p>Next time she tried so very hard to sit
still that she swayed to and fro like a
slender-stemmed flower when the wind goes
over it. The picture was blurred.</p>

<p>"O, Fly, you must keep your shoulders
still," said Prudy, looking as anxious as
the old woman in the shoe.</p>

<p>"I didn't never want to come here,"
said the child; "when I sit so still, Prudy,
it 'most gives me a pain."</p>

<p>"But you haven't sat still yet, not a
minute."</p>

<p>"I could, you know, Prudy, <i>or nelse</i> I
didn't have to breeve," groaned Flyaway,
lifting her eyebrows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Another one spoiled," said the artist,
trying to smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dotty, who felt none of the
care. "Once it was her head, and then it
was her shoulders; and now her eyebrows
are all of a quirk."</p>

<p>Poor little Flyaway felt as much out of
place as a grape-vine would feel, if it had
to make believe it was a pine tree.</p>

<p>"Wisht I'd said 'no,' 'stead o' 'yes,'"
murmured she, puckering her mouth to the
size of a very small button-hole.</p>

<p>"This will never do," said the patient
artist, almost in despair. "Hold your little
chin up, there's a lady. Don't put it
in your neck. Now!  Ready!"</p>

<p>But at the critical moment there was a
jerk, and Flyaway cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've got a sneeze; but, O, dear, I can't
sneeze it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, where's that head of yours, little
Tot? I declare, I believe it goes on
wires, like a jumping-jack."</p>

<p>"My head's wrong side up," said Flyaway,
mournfully; "my mother said it was."</p>

<p>Mr. Poindexter laughed: it was impossible
to be vexed with such a gentle child
as Flyaway. "Really, my young friends,"
said he, rubbing his stained fingers through
his hair, "I believe I shall be obliged to
give it up for the present. Have the
child's mother come with her to-morrow,
and we'll do better, I am sure."</p>

<p>With the likenesses of the other girls he
succeeded very well; and Prudy and Dotty
were glad to find, that after paying for
theirs, they each had ten cents left.</p>

<p>"Now, Fly, we will go to aunt Martha's."</p>

<p>But Fly was amusing herself by scraping
dirt out of the cracks of her boots with a
bit of glass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dotty won't be to aunt Marfie's. I
don't want to stay where Dotty isn't."</p>

<p>"But your mamma will be there, you
know; and I told you what they are going
to have for dinner."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>secretary</i>," said Flyaway, proud
of her memory. "She is a very nice <i>cooker</i>,
but you'll have hard work to get me
to go."</p>

<p>She drawled out the words languidly, and
seemed on the point of going to sleep.</p>

<p>"O, girls, girls, girls," cried Prudy,
opening the door and looking out, "our
wheelbarrow is gone&mdash;it's gone!"</p>

<p>"It's bugglers; I told you so," said Dotty.</p>

<p>Mr. Poindexter was quite amused by his
little sitters. "I saw that you came in a
coach," said he, "and without any horses."</p>

<p>"Our grandmother said we might," spoke
up Dotty, anxious to divert all blame from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
herself. "She said we might; but Prudy
ought to have gone straight home. I knew
it all the time."</p>

<p>"I dare say some one has driven off
your carriage in sport," said the kind-hearted
photographer; "never fear."</p>

<p>"O, no, sir; it was new and red. Folks
wanted it to haul stones in, and that was
why they took it," said Dotty, wrathfully.</p>

<p>The children looked up street and down
street. No wheelbarrow in sight. "We
must go to aunt Martha's, and then come
back and hunt for it, if we have to go
without our dinners," they said. They
took Flyaway between them, and marched
her off. She was almost as passive as a
rag baby, ready to drop down anywhere,
and fall asleep. "'Cause I <i>am</i> so tired,"
said she.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha cordially invited the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
cousins to dine. They thanked her, but
no, they must find the wheelbarrow. "We
shan't say, certain positive, that bugglers
took it, but we s'pose so," said Dotty,
softening her judgment, as she remembered
her mistake about the "screw-up pencil."
They went home through the broiling sun,
but found no trace of the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>"It's a dreadful thing," said Prudy, lazily,
"but I don't feel as bad as I should
if I was fairly awake."</p>

<p>"Me, too," yawned Dotty; "I wish we
could lie down under the trees, and go
to sleep."</p>

<p>They had been a long while in the close
saloon, inhaling ether, and this was the
cause of their languor. As they entered
the yard they met Horace.</p>

<p>"O, dear," said Dotty, trying to look
as sorry as she knew she ought to feel,
"that wheel&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Prudy.</p>

<p>There, under a syringa tree in the garden,
stood the wheelbarrow. The girls
rubbed their eyes, and wondered if they
were walking in their sleep.</p>

<p>"That thing trundled itself in here about
half an hour ago," said Horace, gravely.
"You may know I was surprised to look
up, and see it coming without hands, just
rolling along like a velocipede."</p>

<p>Dotty eyed the runaway wheelbarrow stupidly.
"I don't believe it," said she, flatly.</p>

<p>Horace laughed; and then the fog cleared
away from Dotty's mind in a minute.</p>

<p>"Why, girls," said he, "how long did
you think I could wait to haul off my
weeds? You were gone two hours. I
watched you on your parade, and followed
at a respectful distance."</p>

<p>"There, Horace Clifford!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"In order not to disturb the procession.
Then, when I saw you going into the
saloon, I went up and claimed my wheelbarrow.
Didn't want it any longer&mdash;did
you?"</p>

<p>"No, and never want it again," said
Prudy.</p>

<p>"By the way, here's a conundrum for
you, girls, Why's a wheelbarrow like a
potato?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think it was like it at all,"
answered Dotty. "Where did you read
that?"</p>

<p>"Didn't read it anywhere. I've given
up books since I undertook gardening.
Never was much of a bookworm. Make
a very respectable <i>earth-worm</i>; ask aunt
Louise if I don't."</p>

<p>The little girls entered the house, too
tired and sleepy to make any reply.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>WAKING.</h3>


<p>Flyaway was very much sleepier than
either of her cousins, and really did not
know where she was, or what she was
doing. Lonnie Adams, a boy of Horace's
age, tried to interest her. He made believe
the old cat was a sheep, killed her with an
iron spoon, and hung her up by the hind
legs for mutton, all which Pussy bore like
a lamb, for she had been killed a great
many times, and was used to it. But it
did not please Flyaway; neither did aunt
Martha's collection of shells and pictures
call forth a single smile.  There was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
beautiful clock in the parlor, and the pendulum
was in the form of a little boy
swinging; but Flyaway would not have
cared if it had been a gallows, and the
boy hanging there dead.</p>

<p>Uncle John took her on his knee, asked
her what her name was, where she lived,
and whom she loved best; but she only
answered she "didn't know." She might
have been Daniel in the lions' den, or Joseph
in the pit, for all the difference to her.</p>

<p>"How very singular!" said aunt Martha.
"I wish her mother would come. Do feel
her pulse, John, and see if it is fever."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," said uncle John,
as the little one's head dropped on his
shoulder. "Overcome by the heat; that's
all. I'll just lay her down on the sofa."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Clifford came, she was surprised
to find the child fast asleep. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
would not have her wakened for dinner;
so Flyaway missed her "secretary." But
when it was three o'clock, and she still
slept, Mrs. Clifford feared something was
wrong, and decided to take her home.
Uncle John had "Lightning Dodger" harnessed,
and brought around to the door.</p>

<p>"Wake up, little daughter," said Mrs.
Clifford; "we are going home now."</p>

<p>Flyaway looked around vacantly, her eyes
as heavy as drenched violets.</p>

<p>"You must come again, and stay longer,"
said aunt Martha; "it is hardly polite not
to let little girls have their dinners&mdash;do
you think it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes 'm," replied Flyaway, faintly. She
did not understand a word any one said;
it all sounded as indistinct as the roaring
of a sea-shell. By the time she was lifted
into her mother's arms in the carriage, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was nodding again. When they reached
home she scarcely spoke, but, dropping
upon the sofa, went on with her dreams.
It was odd for Flyaway to take a nap in
the daytime, and such a long one as this!</p>

<p>"It must be a very warm day," said
Mrs. Parlin, "for Prudy and Dotty have
been asleep too."</p>

<p>"Where did they go after they sold the
rags?" asked Mrs. Clifford; "they all
look pale."</p>

<p>"To a photograph saloon. Here are the
tin-types they brought home to me," replied
grandma, producing them from her
pocket, with a gratified smile.</p>

<p>"Very good, mother&mdash;don't you think
so? I would be glad to have as truthful
a likeness of our little Katie; but she must
be taken asleep. I wonder, by the way,
if there wasn't something in the air of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
saloon which made the children all so languid?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Maria; very likely it was
the ether. Now you speak of it, I am confident
it must have been the ether."</p>

<p>"I knew just such an instance before,"
said Mrs. Clifford; "and that is why I
happened to think of it now."</p>

<p>About four o'clock Flyaway came to her
senses.</p>

<p>"Where's the wheelbarrel?" said she,
rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p>"O, Horace came and took it," said
Dotty. "Hasn't this been the queerest
day!"</p>

<p>"You said you's goin' to take me to
aunt Marfie's; why didn't you?"</p>

<p>"O, we did; we took you, you know."</p>

<p>"Dotty Dimpul, I shouldn't think you'd
make any believe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not 'making any believe'&mdash;am I,
Prudy?"</p>

<p>"No, Fly, she isn't. We pulled you
along,&mdash;don't you remember?&mdash;and you
hung back, and said, 'I <i>am</i> so tired.'"</p>

<p>"I don't 'member," said Flyaway, slowly
and sadly. "I shouldn't think <i>you'd</i> make
any believe, Prudy."</p>

<p>"We'll ask your mamma, then; she tells
the truth. Aunt 'Riah, didn't we take
Flyaway to aunt Martha's this morning,
and didn't you go there too?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mrs. Clifford; "but it
wasn't much of a visit,&mdash;was it, darling!&mdash;when
you slept most of the time, and
didn't have a mouthful of dinner?"</p>

<p>Flyaway sighed heavily, and looked at
her mother. "O, mamma! mamma!"</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>"O, mamma," repeated she, sorrowfully,
"why did you say those words?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"What words, darling?"</p>

<p>"Those naughty, naughty words, mamma."
Flyaway's gentle eyes were afloat.
She crossed the room, and knelt by Mrs.
Clifford's chair, looking up at her with an
expression of anguish.</p>

<p>"That man, he wasn't in the lions' den,
that prayed so long and so loud, mamma."</p>

<p>"Well, dear."</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> telled a wrong story to me, mamma."</p>

<p>"My darling baby," said Mrs. Clifford,
catching Flyaway in her arms, "do you
think your own dear mother is telling you
a wrong story this minute?"</p>

<p>"'Cause, 'cause, mamma, I didn't go to
aunt Marfie's!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, my precious daughter;
but you were asleep and dreaming. We
brought you home in the carriage, and
you didn't know it. Can't you believe it
because I say so?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Flyaway made no reply except to curl
her head under Mrs. Clifford's arm, like a
frightened chicken under its mother's wing.
Mrs. Clifford looked troubled. She was
afraid the little one could not be made to
understand it. Horace came to her aid.</p>

<p>"Hold up your head, little Topknot,
and hear brother talk. Once there were
three little girls, and they all travelled
round with a wheelbarrow. By and by
they came to a man's house on wheels."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Flyaway, starting up; "I
'member."</p>

<p>"And the wee girl, with dove's eyes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, O, that's me!"</p>

<p>"She couldn't keep still, and couldn't
get any picture."</p>

<p>"No, <i>tin-tybe</i>; 'cause&mdash;'cause&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And all the while there was something
in the man's house they kept breathing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
into their noses, and it made them grow
sleepy."</p>

<p>"Just so?" asked Flyaway, sniffing.</p>

<p>"Yes; and by and by the little one with
dove's eyes was as stupid as that woman
you saw lying down in the street with the
pig looking at her."</p>

<p>"Me? Was I a <i>drunken</i>?" said Flyaway,
in a subdued tone.</p>

<p>"O, no," put in Dotty; "it wasn't whiskey,
it was <i>either</i>; and I didn't know much
more than you did, Fly Clifford. That
was why I lost your money, Prudy; I
just about know it was."</p>

<p>Flyaway began to understand. The look
of fear and distrust went out of her eyes,
and she threw her arms round her mother's
neck, kissing her again and again.</p>

<p>"<i>'Haps</i> I did go to aunt Marfie's, mamma;
<i>'haps</i> I was asleep!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right, Miss Topknot," cried Horace;
"now your brother'll carry you pickaback."</p>

<p>A little while afterward Mrs. Clifford
began a letter to her husband.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell papa about his little
girl&mdash;that she is very well."</p>

<p>"O, no, you needn't, mamma," said
Flyaway, laughing; "papa knows it. I
was well at home."</p>

<p>"What shall I tell him, then?"</p>

<p>Flyaway thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Tell him all the folks doesn't tell lies,"
said she, earnestly; "only but the naughty
folks tells lies."</p>

<p>So that was settled; and Flyaway decided
to write off the whole story, and send
to her father&mdash;a mixture of little sharp
zigzags, curves, and dots. When Horace
asked her what these meant, she said "she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
couldn't 'member now; but papa would
know."</p>

<p>There was another matter which troubled
grandma Parlin somewhat. Dotty had gone
to the store, after dinner, with two ten-cent
pieces in her porte-monnaie. She
had bought for herself some jujube paste,
but in returning had lost the other dime.</p>

<p>"Grandma, do you think that is fair?"
said Prudy. "She has lost my money, but
she doesn't care at all; only laughs. I was
going to put it with some more I had, and
buy mother a collar."</p>

<p>"No, it is not right," replied grandma.
"I will talk with her, and try to make
her willing to give you some of hers in
return."</p>

<p>Ah, grandma Parlin, you little knew
what you were undertaking when you
called Dotty Dimple into the back parlor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
next morning, and began to talk about
that money! Children's minds are strange
things. They are like bottles with very
small necks; and when you pour in an
idea, you must pour very slowly, a drop
at a time, or it all runs over. Dotty did
not know much more about money than
Flyaway.</p>

<p>"My child," said her grandmother, "it
seems you have lost something which belonged
to Prudy."</p>

<p>Dotty looked up carelessly from the picture
of a rose she held in her hand, which
she meant to adorn with yellow paint.</p>

<p>"O, yes 'm; you mean that money."</p>

<p>"There are several things you don't
know, Dotty; and one is, that you have no
right to lose other people's things."</p>

<p>"No 'm."</p>

<p>"The money you dropped out of your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
porte-monnaie, yesterday, was Prudy's, not
yours; and what are you going to do about
it?"</p>

<p>"Let me see; my mother'll come to-morrow;
I'll ask her to give me some
more."</p>

<p>"But is that right? Dotty lost the
money; must not Dotty be the one to give
it back?"</p>

<p>"O, grandma, I can't find it! The wind
blew it away, or a horse stepped on it. I
can't find it, certainly."</p>

<p>"No; but you have money of your own.
You can give some of that to Prudy."</p>

<p>"Why-ee!" moaned Dotty. "Prudy's
got ever so much. O, grandma, she has;
and my box is so empty it can't but just
jingle."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, that has nothing to do
with the case.  If Prudy has a great deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of money, you have no right to lose any
of it. Don't you think you ought to give
it back?"</p>

<p>"O, no, grandma&mdash;I don't; because she
doesn't need it! I wish she'd give <i>me</i> ten
cents, for I do need it; I haven't but a
tinty, tonty mite."</p>

<p>Here Dotty threw herself on the sofa,
the picture of despair. Grandma was perplexed.
Had she been pouring ideas into
Dotty's mind too fast? What should she
say next?</p>

<p>"My dear little girl, suppose Prudy
should lose some of your money&mdash;what
then?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like it at all, grandma. Don't
let her go to my box&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"Selfish little girl!" said grandma, looking
keenly at Dotty's troubled face. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
would expect Prudy to return every cent,
if she were in your place."</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;grandma&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; and when I explain your duty to
you, you don't understand me. You would
understand if you were not so selfish!"</p>

<p>Dotty winced.</p>

<p>"Don't come to me again, and complain
of Jennie Vance."</p>

<p>Dotty could not meet her grandmother's
searching gaze: it seemed to cut into her
heart like a sharp blade.</p>

<p>"Am I as bad as Jennie Vance? Yes,
just us bad; and grandma knows it. But
then," said she aloud, though very faintly,
"Prudy needn't have put it in my porte-monnaie;
she might have known I'd lose
it."</p>

<p>"Dotty, I am not going to say any more
about it now. You may think it over to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>-day,
and decide for yourself whether you
are following the Golden Rule. Or, if you
choose, you may wait and talk with your
mother."</p>

<p>"Yes 'm."  Dotty was glad to escape
into the kitchen.</p>

<h3>AUNT POLLY'S STORY.</h3>


<p>Flyaway sat on the kitchen floor, feeding
Dinah with a roasted apple. As often
as Dinah refused a teaspoonful, she put
it into her own mouth, saying, with a wise
nod, "My child, she's sick; hasn't any
<i>appletite</i>."</p>

<p>Out of doors it was raining heartily. It
seemed as if the "upper deep" was tipping
over, and pouring itself into the lap of the
earth.</p>

<p>"O, Ruthie," sighed Dotty Dimple, "my
mother won't come while it's such weather.
Do you s'pose 'twill ever clear off?"
[Blank Page]</p>

<p class="center"><img class="img1" src="images/image_06.jpg" alt="Flyaway and Dinah." width="400" height="665" /><br />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Flyaway and Dinah.</span></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I do," replied Ruth, trimming a
pie briskly; "it only began last night at
five."</p>

<p>"Why, Ruthie Dillon! it began three
weeks ago, by the clock! Don't you know
that day I couldn't go visiting? Only
sometimes it stops a while, and then begins
again."</p>

<p>"If you're going to have the blues, Miss
Dotty, I'll thank you kindly just to take
yourself out of this kitchen. Polly Whiting
is here, and she is as much as a body
can endures in this dull weather."</p>

<p>"It's pitiful 'bout the rain, Dotty; but
you mustn't scold when God sended it,"
said Flyaway, dropping the feeble Dinah,
and pursuing her cousin round the room
with a pin. In a minute they were both
laughing gayly, till Flyaway caught herself
on her little rocking-chair, and "got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a <i>torn</i> in her apron." That ended the
sport.</p>

<p>"What shall I do to make myself happy?"
said Dotty, musingly; for she wished
to put off all thought of Prudy's money.
"I should like to roll out some thimble-cookies,
but Ruthie hasn't much patience
this morning. I never dare do things when
her lips are squeezed together so."</p>

<p>But Flyaway dared do things. She took
up the kitty, and played to her on the
"music," till Ruth's ears were "on edge."
After this the harmonica fell into a dish
of soft soap, and in cleaning it with ashes
and a sponge, the holes became stopped.</p>

<p>"It won't <i>muse</i> no more," said Flyaway,
in sad surprise, blowing into the keys in
vain. Ruth loved the little child too well
to say she was glad of it.</p>

<p>Flyaway's next dash was into the sink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
cupboard, where she found a wooden bowl
of sand. This she dragged out, and filling
her "nipperkin" with water, carried them
both to Ruth, saying, in her sweet, pleading
way,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>If</i> you please, Ruthie, will you tell
<i>how</i> God does when he takes the 'little
drops of water and little grains of sand,'
and makes 'the mighty <i>oshum</i>' with um,
'<i>and</i> the pleasant land'?"</p>

<p>Ruthie had no answer but a kiss and a
smile.</p>

<p>"There, away with you into the nursery,
both of you. I know Polly Whiting is
lonesome without you."</p>

<p>Off went the children, Flyaway "with
a heart for any fate," but Dotty still oppressed
by the shadow of the ten-cent
piece.</p>

<p>"If I don't give it to Prudy, will I be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
dishonest? Will I be as bad as Jennie
Vance?"</p>

<p>When they entered the nursery, Miss
Polly was standing before the mirror, arranging
her black cap, and weaving into
her collar a square black breast-pin, which
aunt Louise said looked like a gravestone.
Flyaway peeped in too, placing her smooth
pink cheek beside Miss Polly's wrinkled
one.</p>

<p>"I don't look alike, Miss Polly," said
she; "and you don't look alike too."</p>

<p>Certainly not; no more alike than a
blush-rose bud and a dried apple.</p>

<p>"What makes the red go out of folks'
cheeks when they grow old, and the wrinkles
crease in, like the pork in baked
beans?" queried Dotty.</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you," replied the good
lady, giving a pat to her cap, and settling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the bows carefully; "but if you had asked
how I happened to grow old before my
time, I should say I'd had such a hard
chance through life, and trouble always
leaves its mark."</p>

<p>"Does it? O, dear! I have trouble,&mdash;ever
so much; will it quirk my face all
up, like yours?"</p>

<p>"You have trouble, Dotty Parlin? Haven't
you found out yet that the lines have fallen
to you in pleasant places?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by lines,"
said Dotty, thinking of fish-hooks; "but
when it rains, and folks want me to do
things that are real hard, then why, I'm
blue, now truly."</p>

<p>"Then we're blue, now truly," added
Flyaway by way of finish.</p>

<p>"What would you do, children, if you
were driven about, as I used to be, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
post to pillar, with no mother to care for
you?"</p>

<p>"If I hadn't no mamma, I could go barefoot,
like a dog," said Flyaway, brightening
with the new idea; "I could paddle in
the water too, and eat pepnits."</p>

<p>"O, child! But what if you had neither
father nor mother?"</p>

<p>"Then," said Flyaway coolly, "I should
go to some house where there <i>was</i> a father'n
mother."</p>

<p>"Why, you little heartless thing! But
that is always the way with children; their
parents set their lives by them, but not a
'thank you' do they get for their love!
Try a pinch," continued she, offering her
snuff-box to the little folks, who both declined.
This Polly thought was strange.
They must like snuff if they followed the
natural bent of their noses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Katie, as I was saying, you little
know how your mother loves you."</p>

<p>"Yes um, I do. She loves me more 'n
the river, and the sky, and the bridge.
My papa loves me too, only but he don't
<i>say</i> nuffin' 'bout it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; just so," said Miss Polly,
who talked to the simplest infants just as
she did to grown people. "One of these
days you will look back, and see how
happy you are now, and be sorry you
didn't prize your parents while you had
them."</p>

<p>Flyaway rested her rosy cheek on Polly's
knee, and watched the gray knitting-work
as it came out of the basket. She did not
understand the sad woman's words, but
was attracted by her loving nature, and
liked to sit near her, a minute at a time,
and have her hair stroked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, now," said Dotty, "you are
knitting, Miss Polly; and it's so lonesome
all round the house, with mother not coming
till to-morrow, that I should think you
might tell&mdash;well, tell an anecdote."</p>

<p>"I don't know where to begin, or what to
say," replied Polly, falling into deep thought.</p>

<p>"I just believe she does sigh at the end
of every needle," mused Dotty; "I'm going
to keep 'count. That's once."</p>

<p>"Please, Miss Polly, tell a <i>nanny-goat</i>,"
said Flyaway, dancing around the room.
"Please, Miss Polly, and I'll kiss you a
pretty little kiss."</p>

<p>"Twice," whispered Dotty.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you something that will
pass for an anecdote, on condition that
you call me <i>aunt</i> Polly; that name warms
my heart a great deal better than <i>Miss</i>
Polly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Three!" said Dotty aloud. "We will,
honestly, if we can think of it, aunt Polly.&mdash;Four."</p>

<p>"Le'me gwout for the sidders, first,"
said busy Flyaway.</p>

<p>"There, aunt Polly, you forgot it that
time! You sprang up quick to shut the
door, and forgot it."</p>

<p>"Forgot what?"</p>

<p>"You didn't sigh at the end of your
needle."</p>

<p>"Why, Dotty, how you do talk! Any
one would suppose, by that, I was in the
habit of sighing! I have a stitch in my
side, child, and it makes me draw a long
breath now and then; that's all."</p>

<p>Flyaway was back again,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With step-step light, and tip-tap slight<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Against the door."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"Come in," said Dotty, "and see if you
can keep still two whole minutes; but I
know you can't."</p>

<p>Miss Polly let her work fall in her lap,
and drew up the left sleeve of her black
alpaca dress. "Do you see that scar,
children?"</p>

<p>It was just below the elbow,&mdash;an irregular,
purple mark, about the size of a new
cent.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss&mdash;why, aunt Polly!"</p>

<p>"I've got one on me too," said Flyaway,
pulling at her apron sleeve; "Hollis
did it with the tongs."</p>

<p>"It can't be; not a scar like mine."</p>

<p>"Bigger 'n' larger 'n' yours; only but I
can't find it," said Flyaway, carefully twisting
around her dainty white arm, which
Polly kissed, and said was as sweet as a
peach. "Bigger 'n' larger 'n' yours. Where's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
it gone to?  O, I feegot&mdash;'twas on my
<i>sleeve</i>, and I never put it on to-day."</p>

<p>"You're a droll child, not to know the
difference between scars and dirt! When
I was almost as young and quite as innocent,
that wicked little boy bit me, and
I shall carry the marks of his teeth to my
grave." With another lingering glance at
the purple mark, Polly drew down her
sleeve, sighed, and began to knit again.</p>

<p>"Was it the woman's child that made
you dig, that you told about last summer?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was a bound girl."</p>

<p>"Bound to what?" Dotty was trying
to drown the remembrance of Prudy's ten
cents; so she wished to keep Miss Polly
talking.</p>

<p>"Bound to Mrs. Potter till I was eighteen
years old. Her husband kept public house.
They made a perfect slave of me. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
I was twelve years old I had to milk three
cows, besides spinning my day's work on
the flax-wheel. And very often all I had
for supper was brown bread and skim milk.
I didn't have any grandfather's house to
go to, with a seat in the trees, and a boat
on the water, and a swing, and a summer
house, and a <i>crocky-set</i> (croquet set).
Not I!"</p>

<p>Flyaway was cutting paper dolls with all
speed, but her sweet little face was drawn
into curves of pity.</p>

<p>"Too bad! Naughty folks to give you
<i>skilmick</i>."</p>

<p>"I had to scour all the knives too. I
did it by drawing them back and forth into
a sand-bank back of the house. This Isaac
I speak of was a lazy boy, and very unkind
to me; but his mother wouldn't hear a
word against him. One day I brushed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
traveller's coat, and got a silver quarter for
my trouble. I thought everything of that
quarter. I had never had so much money
before in my life. I had half a mind to
put it in the Savings Bank; 'and who
knows,' thought I, 'but I can add more to
it, one of these days, and buy my time.'"</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Polly, I didn't know you
could <i>buy</i> time!"</p>

<p>"But you knew you could throw it away,
I suppose," said Polly, with a sad smile.
"What I mean is this: I wanted to pay
Mrs. Potter some money, so I could go
free before I was eighteen."</p>

<p>"Then you would be <i>unbound</i>, aunt
Polly."</p>

<p>"Yes; but one day Isaac found my
money,&mdash;I kept it in an old tobacco-box,&mdash;and,
just to hector me, he kept tossing
it up in the air, till all of a sudden it fell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>through a crack in the floor; and that was
the last I saw of it."</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/image_07.jpg" alt="&quot;HERE HE IS!&quot;" width="400" height="263" /><br />
<span class="caption">"HERE HE IS!"</span></p>

<p>"What a naughty, careless boy!"</p>

<p>After Dotty had said this, she blushed.</p>

<p>"Naughty, careless boy!" echoed Flyaway.
"Here he is!" holding up a paper
doll shaped very much like a whale, with
the fin divided for legs, the ears of a cat,
and the arms of a windmill. "Here he is!"</p>

<p>"He didn't look much like that," said
Polly, laughing. "He had plenty of money
of his own, and I tried to make him give
me back a quarter; but do you believe he
wouldn't, not even a ninepence? And
when I teased him, that was the time he
bit my arm."</p>

<p>"He oughtn't to bitted your arm, course,
indeed not!"</p>

<p>"But, aunt Polly," faltered Dotty, whose
efforts to forget the ten-cent piece had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
proved worse than useless, "but it didn't
do Isaac any good to lose your money
down a crack."</p>

<p>"No, it was sheer mischief."</p>

<p>"And if it doesn't do folks any good to
lose things, you know, why, what's the
use&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;go and get his own money
to pay it back with?&mdash;Isaac I mean."</p>

<p>"What do you say, Dotty Parlin? You,
a child that goes to Sabbath school! Don't
you know it is a sin to steal a pin? And
if we lose or injure other people's things,
and don't make it up to them, we're as
good as thieves."</p>

<p>"As good?"</p>

<p>"As bad, then."</p>

<p>"But s'posin'&mdash;s'posin' folks lose things
when they <i>don't</i> toss 'em up in the air,
and don't mean to,&mdash;the wind, you know,
or a kind of an accident, Miss Polly,&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"And s'posin' I didn't have any more
money 'n I wanted myself, and Prudy had
the most&mdash;H'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Then it isn't as bad as thieves; now is
it? She's got the most. Prudy's older 'n
I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Honesty is honesty," said Miss Polly,
firmly, "in young or old. If you've lost
your sister's money, you must make it up
to her."</p>

<p>"O, must I, Miss Polly? Such a tinty-tonty
mite of money as I've got,&mdash;only
sixty-five cents."</p>

<p>"Honesty is honesty," repeated Miss
Polly, "in rich or poor."</p>

<p>"Dear me! will my mother say so, too?"</p>

<p>"Your mother is on the right side, Dotty.
The Bible tells us to 'deal justly.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
There's nothing said there about excusing
poor folks."</p>

<p>"O, dear! do you s'pose the Bible expects
me to pay Prudy Parlin ten cents,
when it just blew out of my hands, and
didn't do me a speck of good?"</p>

<p>"Why, Dotty, you surprise me! Any
one would think you were brought up a
heathen! If you were a small child I
could understand it."</p>

<p>"I knew I should have to do it," moaned
Dotty.</p>

<p>"I advise you to lose no time about it,
then; that is the cause of your blues, I
guess. We can't be happy out of the line
of our duty," sighed Miss Polly, who regarded
herself as a pattern of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'm going to do,"
said Dotty, resolutely; "I'm going right
off to pay that money to Prudy, and then
I'll be in the line of my duty."</p>

<h3>FULL NIPPERKIN.</h3>


<p>Prudy scorned to take the ten cents.
"Did you think your 'middle-aged' sister
would do such a thing, when she has more
money than you have, Dotty Dimple? If
you're only sorry, that's all I ask. I didn't
like to have you laugh, as if you didn't
care."</p>

<p>"But, Prudy, I want to be honest."</p>

<p>"And so you have been, dear child,"
said grandma Parlin, with an approving
smile. "If Prudy chooses now to give you
the money, receive it as a present, and
say, 'Thank you.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, thank you, Prudy Parlin, over and
over, and up to the moon," cried Dotty,
throwing her arms around her kind sister's
neck. "I'll never lose anything of yours
again; no, never, never!"</p>

<p>This lesson was laid away on a shelf in
Dotty's memory. Close beside it was another
lesson, still more wholesome.</p>

<p>"Dotty Dimple isn't the best girl that
ever lived. She had to be talked to and
talked to, before she was willing to do
right. She isn't any better than Jennie
Vance, after all. Why did she pray that
naughty prayer, just to make Jennie feel
bad? God must have thought it was very
strange!"</p>

<p>Grandma saw that Dotty's "blues" were
dissolving like a morning mist; still she
knew the child was in need of patchwork,
and told her so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us all take our work," said she,
"and sit together in the nursery, so we
may forget the dull weather."</p>

<p>Grace brought her piqu&eacute; apron down
stairs to make, Susy her tatting, Prudy a
handkerchief, Dotty a square of patchwork,
while Flyaway danced about for a needle
and thread.</p>

<p>"What a happy group!" said Mrs. Clifford,
looking up from her sewing. She
had forgotten Polly Whiting, who was
mournfully toeing off a sock for Horace,
while he sat on the floor, at her feet, mending
her double-covered basket.</p>

<p>"Why, Katie, darling," said Grace, "what
are you doing with that beautiful ribbon?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Louise said I might make a bag,
Gracie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seems to me aunt Louise lets you do
everything; I shouldn't want you to spoil
that ribbon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"They shan't bother my little Topknot,"
said Horace, with a sweep of his thumb.
"She is going to have all my clothes to
make bags of, when she grows up."</p>

<p>Flyaway, who knew she had a good right
to the ribbon, pressed her eyelids together
slowly.</p>

<p>"If I's Gracie," said she, severely, "I'd
make aprons; if I's mamma I'd sew dresses;
if I's Flywer, I'd do just's I want to."</p>

<p>And then she went on sewing; without
any thimble.</p>

<p>"Girls, have you guessed yet why a
wheelbarrow is like a potato?"</p>

<p>"No, Horace; why is it?"</p>

<p>"O, I was in hopes you could tell. I
don't know, I am sure. It is as much as
I can do to make up a conundrum, without
finding out the answer."</p>

<p>The children laughed at this, but none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of them so loud as Flyaway, who thought
her brother the wisest, wittiest, and noblest
specimen of boyhood that ever lived.</p>

<p>"How our needles do fly!" said Dotty,
merrily.</p>

<p>She was a neat and swift little seamstress,
even superior to Prudy.</p>

<p>"See," said Flyaway to Horace; "I work
faster 'n my mamma, 'cause she's got a big
dress to work on: of course she can't sew
so quick as I can on a little bag."</p>

<p>"Prudy can sew better and faster than
I can," said Dotty, with a sudden gush of
humility.</p>

<p>"Why, Dotty Dimple, I don't think so,"
returned Prudy, quite surprised.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," said aunt Maria; "I
am afraid our little Dotty is hardly sincere."</p>

<p>Dotty's head drooped a little. "I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it, auntie; I do sew the nicest; but I
was afraid it wouldn't be polite if I told
it just as it was, and Prudy so good to
me, too."</p>

<p>"If she is good, is that any reason why
you should tell her a wrong story?" remarked
the plain-spoken Susy, giving a
twitch to her tatting-thread.</p>

<p>"Children," said Mrs. Clifford, laughing,
"do you remember those hideous green
goggles I wore a year ago?"</p>

<p>"O, yes 'm," replied Grace; "they made
your eyes stick out so! Why, you looked
like a frog, ma', more than anything else."</p>

<p>"Well, a certain lady of my acquaintance
was so polite as to tell me my goggles
were very becoming."</p>

<p>"O, ma, who could it have been?"</p>

<p>"I prefer not to give you her name. I
appreciated her kind wish to please me,
but I could not think her sincere."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, Susy," said Grace, "if you could
have seen those goggles! A little basket
for each eye, made of green wire, like a
fly cover! Ma, did you ever believe a
word that lady said afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Flatterers are not generally to be trusted,"
replied Mrs. Clifford. "Flyaway, that
is the fourth needle you have lost."</p>

<p>Here was another lesson for Dotty's
memory-shelf. "I must not say things that
are not true, just to be polite. It is flattering
and wicked; and besides that, people
always know better."</p>

<p>It was a quiet, busy, cheerful day. Dotty
forgot to complain of the weather. Just
before supper Flyaway jumped down from
her grandpapa's knee, where she had been
talking to him through his "conversation-tube,"
and ran to the window.</p>

<p>"Why, 'tisn't raining," cried she; "true's
I'm walking on this floor 'tisn't raining!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Dotty clapped her hands, and watched
the sun coming out like pure gold, and
turning the dark clouds into silver.</p>

<p>"We were patient and willing for it to
rain," said she; "but of course that wasn't
why it cleared off."</p>

<p>And it wasn't why Flyaway lost her
thumb-nail, either. She lost that&mdash;or half
of it&mdash;in the crack of the door. The
poor little thumb was very painful, and
had to be put in a cot.</p>

<p>"It wearies me," said Flyaway; "it makes
me afraid I shan't ever have a nail on
there again."</p>

<p>Her mother assured her she would. The
same God who calls up the little blades of
grass out of the ground could make a finger-nail
grow.</p>

<p>"Will He?" said Flyaway, smiling
through tears; "but 'haps He'll forget how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
it looks. Musn't I save a piece of my
nail, mamma, and lay it up on the shelf,
so He can see it, and make the other one
like it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford put the nail in her jewel-box,
and I dare say it may be there to
this day.</p>

<p>Just as Flyaway, in her nightie, was
having a frolic with Grace, there was a
sound of wheels. The stage, which Horace
called the "Oriole" because it had a yellow
breast, was rolling into the yard.</p>

<p>"It's my mother&mdash;my mother," cried
the three Parlins together.</p>

<p>Yes, and who was that little girl getting
down just after her? Her hat covered her
eyes. "It isn't Tate Penny!" Why, to
be sure it was! There was her dimpled
chin; and if that wasn't proof enough,
there was the wart on her thumb!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>To think such a glorious thing as this
could happen to Dotty! and she not the
best girl in the world either! A visit
from her bosom friend! "Aunt 'Ria, do
you understand? Aunt Louise? Gracie?
This is <i>Tate Penny</i>!"</p>

<p>"Who asked her to come? How did
she happen to be with mamma, the same
day, in the same cars?"</p>

<p>Well, grandma Parlin invited her to
come. "When one lives in an India-rubber
house," she said, "a few people more
or less make no difference at all. She
wished Dotty's 'nipperkin' of happiness to
be full for once."</p>

<p>And it was: it ran over. There were
joyful days for the next fortnight. I could
never draw the picture of them with my
pen, even if I had the paper left to put
it on. They kept house under the trees;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
they baked their food in a brick oven
Horace made; they gave a party; they had
boat rides; they had swings; they never
went into the house unless it rained; they
were never cross to one another, or rude
to Jennie Vance; it was like living in
fairy-land.</p>

<p>It was a glorious summer. I almost
wish it had not come to an end; though,
in that case, I suppose I should never
have stopped telling about it. By and by
vacation was over, and Tate went off in
the same stage with the Parlins. You
could never guess what she and Dotty each
put so carefully into their bosoms, to keep
"forever." It was a splinter of the dear
old barn where they had had such good
times jumping!</p>

<p>Three weeks afterwards the "Oriole"
drove up to grandpapa Parlin's again, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
this time for the Cliffords. Flyaway danced
into it like a piece of thistle-down. Everybody
threw good-by kisses, and the stage
rattled away.</p>

<p>And after that, dears, as Flyaway will
say to her grandchildren, "things went into
a mist." And this is all I have to tell
you about the Parlins, the Cliffords, and
the Willowbrook home.</p>

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
